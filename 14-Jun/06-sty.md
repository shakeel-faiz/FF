## What is a STY file?

STY file typically refers to a file format used by Yamaha electronic keyboards and synthesizers. Yamaha ".sty" files contain style data defining the rhythm, accompaniment patterns, and other musical elements used by instrument, are used to enhance the playback of MIDI files by providing pre-programmed styles and arrangements.

To use a .sty file with a Yamaha keyboard or synthesizer, you typically transfer the file to instrument using a USB connection or a memory card. Once loaded, the instrument can then apply the style data to accompany MIDI playback or perform live with the selected style.

## Yamaha vs Korg STY Files

Yamaha and Korg save STY files in different formats, meaning they are not cross-platform. Yamaha and Korg are two prominent manufacturers of electronic keyboards and synthesizers and they use their own proprietary file formats for style files. Yamaha provides dedicated software for editing and creating styles, such as Style Fixer or Yamaha Expansion Manager. Korg provides software tools like GNIStyle or Style Works to edit and create styles for Korg keyboards. These programs enable users to modify existing styles or create new ones according to their preferences.
