## What is a RAW file?

A raw file format refers to file format that stores unprocessed and uncompressed data directly from digital image sensor or other sources. It is commonly used in digital photography and imaging.

Unlike file formats like JPEG or PNG, which use compression and processing methods to shrink file size and optimise images for display or printing, raw files contain all the data that the sensor has captured without any modifications. This contains details about colour, brightness, and other sensor-specific information.

Raw files are often specific to particular camera manufacturer and model, as they store data in format unique to sensor and hardware characteristics of that camera. Common raw file formats include CR2 (Canon), NEF (Nikon), ARW (Sony) and DNG (Adobe Digital Negative).

Because raw files are unprocessed, they provide greater flexibility for post-processing adjustments and offer more control over final image. Photographers and professionals prefer working with raw files because they can make precise adjustments to aspects such as exposure, white balance, color grading and noise reduction during editing process.
