## What is a RAF file?

The RAF file format is associated with Fuji RAW image files, which are generated by Fujifilm digital cameras. The acronymn RAF stands for "Fuji Raw Image File."

RAF files contain minimally processed image data directly from camera's image sensor. Unlike JPEG or other compressed image formats, RAF files are considered "raw" because they preserve all the original data captured by camera, including color information, exposure settings, white balance and other camera-specific metadata. This allows photographers to excercise having more control over editing and processing of their images.
