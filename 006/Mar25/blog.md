## What is XML?  
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language and file format used for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing data. It provides a structured approach to encoding information, making it both human-readable and machine-readable.  

***Key Features of XML***

**1. Defined by Open Standards**
- Established by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** in 1998 under the **XML 1.0 Specification**.  
- Follows strict rules to ensure data is structured and easy to interpret.  

**2. Design Goals**
- XML is designed with **simplicity, generality, and usability** across different platforms.  
- Uses a **text-based format**, making it easy to read and edit.  

**3. Unicode Support**
- XML supports **Unicode**, allowing it to store and process text in multiple languages.  

**4. Versatility**
- Initially created for documents, XML is now widely used for data representation across various domains, including **web services, APIs, and configuration files**.  

**5. Schema and APIs**
- XML structures can be defined using **Document Type Definition (DTD)**, **XML Schema (XSD)**, or **Relax NG**.  
- Various APIs, such as **DOM (Document Object Model)** and **SAX (Simple API for XML)**, enable XML processing.  

**6. Common Uses of XML**
- **Data exchange** between different systems (e.g., web services, APIs).  
- **Configuration files** in software applications.  
- **Storing structured information** (e.g., RSS feeds, SVG graphics, document formats like DOCX).  
- **Web development** (e.g., XHTML, SOAP, AJAX-based applications).  

## XML Overview  

**1. XML’s Main Purpose: Serialization**

Serialization in XML means:  
- **Storing data** in a structured format.  
- **Transmitting data** between different systems.  
- **Reconstructing data** in a usable form.  

When two systems need to exchange information, XML provides a **standardized file format** for interoperability. It acts as a **"lingua franca"** for structured data exchange.  

**2. XML as a Markup Language**

XML is a **markup language**, meaning it:  
- **Labels data with tags** for clear structure.  
- **Organizes information** hierarchically.  
- **Categorizes data** with metadata.  

**Example:**

```xml
<book>
    <title>XML Basics</title>
    <author>John Doe</author>
</book>
```
Here, `<book>`, `<title>`, and `<author>` are **tags** that define data elements.  

**3. XML Schema (XSD) and Validation**

An **XML Schema (XSD)** defines structural rules for XML documents.  

XML documents can be:
- **Well-formed** → Follows basic syntax rules (correct nesting, proper closing tags).  
- **Valid** → Conforms to schema rules (mandatory elements, correct data types).  

**Example of an XSD Rule:**

```xml
<xs:element name="title" type="xs:string"/>
```
This ensures that `<title>` must contain a **string value**.  

**4. XML Media Types (RFC 7303)**

The **IETF RFC 7303** defines XML media types for data transmission:  
- **application/xml** → Standard XML data.  
- **application/xml-external-parsed-entity** → Parsed XML entities.  
- **application/xml-dtd** → XML DTD documents.  

For XML-based formats, the **+xml** suffix is used (e.g., `image/svg+xml` for SVG images).  

**5. XML in Networked Applications (RFC 3470 / IETF BCP 70)**

The **IETF BCP 70 (RFC 3470)** outlines best practices for XML use in **network-based applications**, ensuring seamless **data interoperability** across systems.
