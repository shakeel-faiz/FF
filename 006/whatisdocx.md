## What is a DOCX File?

A **DOCX file** is a document file format used by Microsoft Word to store text, images, tables, and other formatting elements. Introduced with Microsoft Office 2007, it is the default file format for Word documents and is part of the Office Open XML (OOXML) standard. DOCX files are widely supported across various platforms, making them a reliable choice for creating and sharing documents.

Unlike the older DOC format, which was binary-based, DOCX files are built on an XML structure. This change allows for better compression, improved compatibility, and easier file recovery in case of corruption.
