In Pakistan, there are very few mainstream *books* specifically dedicated to teaching individuals how to **file their taxes**. However, there are several **practical resources**, guides, and **online alternatives** that serve the same purpose — often more up-to-date than books due to changing tax laws. That said, here’s a breakdown of what you *can* use to learn tax filing in Pakistan:

---

### 📚 **Books (Limited but Available)**

These may not be available in all bookstores but can sometimes be found in university libraries or online:

1. **"Income Tax Law: With Practical Problems" by M. Imtiaz Shahid**

   * Covers basic and advanced concepts of tax law in Pakistan.
   * Focuses more on theory and law than on step-by-step filing.

2. **"Manual of Income Tax" by Altaf Sheikh or similar titles**

   * Often updated annually by local publishers.
   * Usually used by accountants and tax students.
   * Includes case laws, return forms, SROs, and rules.
   * Available at legal bookstores or Urdu Bazar in major cities.

3. **"Taxation in Pakistan" by Dr. Ikram ul Haq**

   * Sometimes includes commentary on laws and case studies.
   * Written in a more analytical style.

> These books are dense, often meant for students, practitioners, or accountants. If you're a layperson, you may find online formats easier.
