GEDCOM and FamilySearch

## **What is GEDCOM?**
GEDCOM (**Genealogical Data Communication**) is an **open file format** designed for **storing, exchanging, and sharing genealogical data** (family tree information). It is widely used in genealogy software and websites, making it easier to **transfer** family tree data between different platforms.

## **Who Developed GEDCOM?**
GEDCOM was created by **The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)**, which operates **FamilySearch**—a major genealogy research organization. Their goal was to simplify genealogy data management and allow better **research collaboration**.

## **How Does GEDCOM Work?**
- GEDCOM files are **plain text files** (now using **UTF-8 encoding** as of version 7.0).
- They contain **information about individuals**, such as:
  - **Names**
  - **Birth and death dates**
  - **Family relationships** (parents, children, spouses)
  - **Events** (marriage, immigration, etc.)
- These records are **linked** using metadata, ensuring proper connections between family members.

## **GEDCOM Versions & Industry Standards**
- The latest official version is **GEDCOM 7.0**, released in **2021**.
- However, **GEDCOM 5.5.1 (from 1999, finalized in 2019)** remains the **most widely used standard**.
- Because GEDCOM 5.5.1 had limitations, some genealogy software developers created **custom extensions** like **GEDCOM 5.5 EL (Extended Locations)** to improve it.

## **Adoption of GEDCOM 7.0**
- **FamilySearch** planned to support GEDCOM 7.0 by **Q3 2022**.
- **Ancestry.com** has also shown interest in adopting it but has not provided a firm implementation date.

## **Why is GEDCOM Important?**
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Allows users to move their family tree data between different genealogy websites and software.
2. **Long-Term Data Storage** – Ensures genealogical data remains accessible in a standardized format.
3. **Genealogy Collaboration** – Enables researchers and family historians to share and merge data efficiently.
