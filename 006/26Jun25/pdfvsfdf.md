## What is the Difference Between PDF and FDF?

If you've ever filled out a form online—like a job application, registration form, or a survey—chances are it was in **PDF format**. PDFs are the standard choice for resumes, contracts, eBooks, and more. But every now and then, you might come across a file with a `.fdf` extension and wonder: **What exactly is an FDF file?** And more importantly, **what's the difference between PDF and FDF?**

Let’s break it down in a simple, non-technical way.

## First, What is a PDF?

**PDF** stands for **Portable Document Format**. It was created by Adobe to present documents consistently across different devices and platforms. A PDF file can contain a mix of text, images, hyperlinks, form fields, and even multimedia like audio or video. It’s designed to look exactly the same whether you open it on a Windows PC, a Mac, or a mobile phone.

Think of a PDF as a _final product_—something you print, share, sign, or store.

## And What is an FDF?

**FDF** stands for **Forms Data Format**. It’s a file format also created by Adobe, but it serves a completely different purpose than a PDF. An FDF file **doesn’t store the entire document**. Instead, it only contains **form data**—basically, the values someone fills into a PDF form, like names, dates, checkboxes, or dropdown selections.

In simpler terms, an FDF is like a list of answers that belong to a quiz, but **not the quiz itself**.

## So, what’s the actual difference between a PDF and an FDF?

Here’s a quick side-by-side comparison of PDF and FDF.
