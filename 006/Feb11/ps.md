## What is PostScript?

**PostScript (PS)** is a **page description language (PDL)** developed by **Adobe Systems** in 1982. It is primarily used in **desktop publishing, printing, and graphic design** to describe how text and images should be rendered on a page.

## Explanation of PostScript (PS)

PostScript (PS) is both a **page description language (PDL)** and a **programming language** that is **dynamically typed** and **stack-based**. Here’s what that means:

### **1. What is a Page Description Language (PDL)?**
A page description language defines how graphics and text appear on a printed page or screen. PostScript is used in **printers, publishing software, and digital typesetting** to accurately render fonts, images, and layouts.

### **2. What is a Stack-Based Programming Language?**
PostScript uses a **stack** to process commands, meaning it follows a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** approach. For example, to add two numbers in PostScript, you push them onto the stack and then call an operator to process them:

```
10 20 add
```
This pushes `10` and `20` onto the stack, then the `add` command pops them off and pushes the result (`30`) back onto the stack.

### **3. Dynamically Typed**
PostScript does not require explicit type definitions. Variables can hold different types (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.) without predefined types.

### **4. Uses of PostScript**
PostScript is mainly used for **desktop publishing and electronic publishing**, meaning it helps create and print high-quality documents with precise control over fonts, layout, and graphics.

### **5. Turing Complete Language**
Being **Turing complete** means PostScript can, in theory, perform any computation given enough memory and time. This means it can be used for general programming tasks, not just printing.

### **6. History and Development**
- Developed by **Adobe Systems** between **1982 and 1984**.
- Created by **John Warnock, Charles Geschke, Doug Brotz, Ed Taft, and Bill Paxton**.
- The latest version, **PostScript 3**, was released in **1997** and added better performance, color management, and image compression.

## PostScript History  

PostScript's origins trace back to **1976**, when **John Gaffney** at **Evans & Sutherland** developed concepts for a page description language while working on a graphics database. Around the same time, **Xerox PARC** was developing **laser printers** and needed a standard for defining page images. They first created the **Press format**, later evolving into **Interpress** in 1978, developed by **John Gaffney and Martin Newell**.  

In **1982**, **John Warnock and Chuck Geschke** left Xerox PARC and co-founded **Adobe Systems**, where they, along with **Doug Brotz, Ed Taft, and Bill Paxton**, developed **PostScript** as a simpler alternative to Interpress. It was released commercially in **1984**.  

### **Apple’s Role in PostScript's Success**  
In **1983**, **Steve Jobs** saw PostScript’s potential for the **Macintosh** and licensed it from Adobe for **$1.5 million**, plus **$2.5 million for 20% of Adobe’s shares**. He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to buy Adobe. Apple and Adobe then worked together to optimize PostScript for **Apple's LaserWriter printer**—launched in **1985**—which played a crucial role in the **desktop publishing revolution**.  

Adobe’s breakthrough in **font rendering and hinting** made PostScript viable even on lower-resolution **300-dpi Canon laser printers**. Adobe did not patent this technology to keep it a trade secret.  

### **PostScript’s Decline and Legacy**  
During the **1980s and 1990s**, PostScript was widely used in **laser printers**, but its **high processing power and memory requirements** made it expensive. As **printers became cheaper** and **computers more powerful**, software-based solutions replaced hardware PostScript processing. By **2001**, most low-end printers dropped PostScript support in favor of **inkjet technology** and **software rendering**.  

However, PostScript remains dominant in **high-end professional printers**, where it **offloads rendering from the computer to the printer**, improving performance. Additionally, **PDF (Portable Document Format)**—a direct descendant of PostScript—has become the **standard for electronic document distribution**.  

## PostScript Levels 

PostScript has evolved through different levels, each improving functionality, performance, and efficiency. There are **three major levels**:  

### **1. PostScript Level 1 (1984)**  
- The original version, released by **Adobe** in **1984**.  
- Provided **device-independent** page descriptions for text, graphics, and images.  
- Allowed precise control over typography and layout.  
- Used in the **first PostScript printers**, including the **Apple LaserWriter**.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Lacked **color support** (only grayscale).  
  - **Slow processing** on complex graphics.  
  - **No built-in image compression**, leading to large file sizes.  

### **2. PostScript Level 2 (1991)**  
- Improved **performance** and **memory efficiency**.  
- Added support for **color printing** (CMYK and spot colors).  
- Introduced **data compression** to reduce file sizes.  
- Enabled **improved font handling** (Type 1 and Type 3 fonts).  
- Introduced **Pattern, Forms, and Composite Fonts** for better text rendering.  
- **Faster processing** of complex graphics compared to Level 1.  

### **3. PostScript 3 (1997)**  
- **Major upgrade** with **more efficient rendering**.  
- **Enhanced color management** with ICC profiles.  
- **Improved support for high-resolution printing** (beyond 2400 dpi).  
- **Better font handling**, including support for **Multiple Master fonts**.  
- **More transparency and shading effects** (better graphics rendering).  
- **Replaced by PDF-based workflows** in modern publishing but still used in high-end printers.  
## PostScript in Printing

### Before PostScript:
- Early printers printed only **text characters**, usually in **ASCII**, with fixed glyphs (e.g., typewriter keys, metal bands, or optical plates).  
- **Dot matrix printers** introduced selectable fonts and custom glyph uploads, along with basic **raster graphics** via escape sequences, but required **specific drivers for each printer model**.  
- **Vector graphics** were handled by **plotters** (e.g., HPGL-based), but these were **slow, expensive, and limited to graphics**.  

### PostScript Printing:
- **Laser printers** combined the strengths of dot matrix printers and plotters, enabling **high-quality text and graphics on the same page**.  
- **PostScript unified printing control** with a **single, device-independent language** that worked across different printers and software.  
- Unlike traditional printer control languages, **PostScript is a full programming language**, allowing **precise document rendering**.  
- **On-the-fly rasterization**: PostScript defines everything (including text) using **straight lines and Bézier curves**, allowing smooth **scaling, rotation, and transformations**.  
- PostScript interpreters, called **Raster Image Processors (RIPs)**, convert instructions into dots needed for final output.

## PostScript Font Handling  

### PostScript Font System
- Uses **graphics primitives** to define **scalable** glyphs.  
- **Font hinting** ensures high-quality rendering, even at **low resolutions**.  
- Fonts were stored in specialized **Type formats** with different capabilities.  

### **PostScript Font Types**  
- **Type 1 Font (T1):**  
  - Proprietary **compressed & encrypted** font format by Adobe.  
  - Used for **high-quality, hinted fonts**.  
  - Adobe initially licensed Type 1 technology for a fee.  

- **Type 3 Font (T3):**  
  - Allowed **full PostScript features**, but lacked **standardized hinting**.  
  - Used by those who couldn't license Type 1 technology.  

- **Type 2 Font (T2) & Compact Font Format (CFF):**  
  - Reduced **font file size** for efficiency.  
  - Became the basis for **OpenType fonts**.  

- **CID-Keyed Fonts:**  
  - Designed for **Asian (CJK) character sets** with **large encoding spaces**.  
  - Could use **Type 1 or Type 2** for different font structures.  

### **Font Format Evolution**  
- **TrueType (1991):**  
  - Developed by **Apple** as a competitor to Adobe’s system.  
  - Forced Adobe to **publish the Type 1 spec** for public use.  

- **OpenType (Late 1990s):**  
  - Jointly developed by **Adobe & Microsoft**.  
  - **Unified Type 1 and TrueType** functionality.  
  - Became the industry standard for modern fonts.  

### **End of Type 1 Support**  
- Adobe officially **ended support for Type 1 fonts in January 2023** in favor of **OpenType**.

## Portable Document Format (PDF) and PostScript

### PDF vs. PostScript

PDF and PostScript are two document formats that produce identical printed output because they use the same underlying graphics system. The key difference lies in their structure: PostScript is a full-fledged programming language, allowing for dynamic operations, while PDF is a more streamlined, static format designed for efficient viewing and navigation.  Despite these differences, it's possible to convert files between the two formats.

- **Similar Imaging Model** – Both **PDF and PostScript** use the same graphics system, ensuring **identical printed output**.  
- **What's the Difference?**   
  - **PostScript** is a **Turing-complete programming language** capable of dynamic operations.  
  - **PDF** is a **static data structure**, optimized for **efficient access and navigation**, making it better for **interactive viewing**.  
- **Mutual Convertibility** – PDFs can be **converted to PostScript**, and vice versa.  

### **The PostScript Language**

PostScript is a stack-based programming language with dynamic typing, similar to Forth but with Lisp-like data structures. It uses Reverse Polish Notation, requiring careful memory management.  PostScript uses arrays and dictionaries, handles typing at runtime, and includes garbage collection. Comments start with "%", and programs typically begin with "%!PS".

- **Turing-Complete & Stack-Based** – Similar to **Forth**, but with **dynamic typing** and **Lisp-like** data structures.  
- **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** – Operators act on a **stack**, requiring careful management.  
- **Memory Management** –  
  - Uses **scoped memory**.  
  - Introduced **garbage collection** in PostScript **Level 2**.  
- **Data Structures** –  
  - Uses **arrays & dictionaries**.  
  - No formal type declarations—typing is managed at runtime.  
- **Comments & Program Structure** –  
  - **%** introduces comments.  
  - Programs typically start with **"%!PS"** to indicate PostScript format.  

### **How PostScript is Used**  
- Mostly **generated by software**, not manually written.  
- Can be used as a **full-fledged programming language** for automation.  
- Interpreted by **printers (RIPs)** or **on-screen viewers**.  

## Example of a Simple PostScript File

Here’s a simple example of a **PostScript (.ps) file** that prints "Hello, World!" on a page:  

```postscript
%!PS
/Times-Roman findfont 24 scalefont setfont
100 700 moveto
(Hello, World!) show
showpage
```

### **Explanation:**
1. `%!PS` → Identifies the file as a PostScript document.  
2. `/Times-Roman findfont 24 scalefont setfont` → Selects the **Times-Roman** font at size **24**.  
3. `100 700 moveto` → Moves the cursor to coordinates **(100, 700)** on the page.  
4. `(Hello, World!) show` → Prints **"Hello, World!"** at the specified position.  
5. `showpage` → Tells the printer to **print the page**.  

You can save this as **hello.ps** and open it with a **PostScript viewer** (e.g., **GSview**, **Ghostscript**) or send it to a **PostScript printer**.
