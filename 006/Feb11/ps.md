## What is PostScript?

**PostScript (PS)** is a **page description language (PDL)** developed by **Adobe Systems** in 1982. It is primarily used in **desktop publishing, printing, and graphic design** to describe how text and images should be rendered on a page.

## Explanation of PostScript (PS)

PostScript (PS) is both a **page description language (PDL)** and a **programming language** that is **dynamically typed** and **stack-based**. Here’s what that means:

### **1. What is a Page Description Language (PDL)?**
A page description language defines how graphics and text appear on a printed page or screen. PostScript is used in **printers, publishing software, and digital typesetting** to accurately render fonts, images, and layouts.

### **2. What is a Stack-Based Programming Language?**
PostScript uses a **stack** to process commands, meaning it follows a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** approach. For example, to add two numbers in PostScript, you push them onto the stack and then call an operator to process them:

```
10 20 add
```
This pushes `10` and `20` onto the stack, then the `add` command pops them off and pushes the result (`30`) back onto the stack.

### **3. Dynamically Typed**
PostScript does not require explicit type definitions. Variables can hold different types (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.) without predefined types.

### **4. Uses of PostScript**
PostScript is mainly used for **desktop publishing and electronic publishing**, meaning it helps create and print high-quality documents with precise control over fonts, layout, and graphics.

### **5. Turing Complete Language**
Being **Turing complete** means PostScript can, in theory, perform any computation given enough memory and time. This means it can be used for general programming tasks, not just printing.

### **6. History and Development**
- Developed by **Adobe Systems** between **1982 and 1984**.
- Created by **John Warnock, Charles Geschke, Doug Brotz, Ed Taft, and Bill Paxton**.
- The latest version, **PostScript 3**, was released in **1997** and added better performance, color management, and image compression.

## PostScript History  

PostScript's origins trace back to **1976**, when **John Gaffney** at **Evans & Sutherland** developed concepts for a page description language while working on a graphics database. Around the same time, **Xerox PARC** was developing **laser printers** and needed a standard for defining page images. They first created the **Press format**, later evolving into **Interpress** in 1978, developed by **John Gaffney and Martin Newell**.  

In **1982**, **John Warnock and Chuck Geschke** left Xerox PARC and co-founded **Adobe Systems**, where they, along with **Doug Brotz, Ed Taft, and Bill Paxton**, developed **PostScript** as a simpler alternative to Interpress. It was released commercially in **1984**.  

### **Apple’s Role in PostScript's Success**  
In **1983**, **Steve Jobs** saw PostScript’s potential for the **Macintosh** and licensed it from Adobe for **$1.5 million**, plus **$2.5 million for 20% of Adobe’s shares**. He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to buy Adobe. Apple and Adobe then worked together to optimize PostScript for **Apple's LaserWriter printer**—launched in **1985**—which played a crucial role in the **desktop publishing revolution**.  

Adobe’s breakthrough in **font rendering and hinting** made PostScript viable even on lower-resolution **300-dpi Canon laser printers**. Adobe did not patent this technology to keep it a trade secret.  

### **PostScript’s Decline and Legacy**  
During the **1980s and 1990s**, PostScript was widely used in **laser printers**, but its **high processing power and memory requirements** made it expensive. As **printers became cheaper** and **computers more powerful**, software-based solutions replaced hardware PostScript processing. By **2001**, most low-end printers dropped PostScript support in favor of **inkjet technology** and **software rendering**.  

However, PostScript remains dominant in **high-end professional printers**, where it **offloads rendering from the computer to the printer**, improving performance. Additionally, **PDF (Portable Document Format)**—a direct descendant of PostScript—has become the **standard for electronic document distribution**.
