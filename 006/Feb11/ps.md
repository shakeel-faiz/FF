## What is PostScript?

**PostScript (PS)** is a **page description language (PDL)** developed by **Adobe Systems** in 1982. It is primarily used in **desktop publishing, printing, and graphic design** to describe how text and images should be rendered on a page.

## Explanation of PostScript (PS)

PostScript (PS) is both a **page description language (PDL)** and a **programming language** that is **dynamically typed** and **stack-based**. Hereâ€™s what that means:

### **1. What is a Page Description Language (PDL)?**
A page description language defines how graphics and text appear on a printed page or screen. PostScript is used in **printers, publishing software, and digital typesetting** to accurately render fonts, images, and layouts.

### **2. What is a Stack-Based Programming Language?**
PostScript uses a **stack** to process commands, meaning it follows a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** approach. For example, to add two numbers in PostScript, you push them onto the stack and then call an operator to process them:

```
10 20 add
```
This pushes `10` and `20` onto the stack, then the `add` command pops them off and pushes the result (`30`) back onto the stack.

### **3. Dynamically Typed**
PostScript does not require explicit type definitions. Variables can hold different types (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.) without predefined types.

### **4. Uses of PostScript**
PostScript is mainly used for **desktop publishing and electronic publishing**, meaning it helps create and print high-quality documents with precise control over fonts, layout, and graphics.

### **5. Turing Complete Language**
Being **Turing complete** means PostScript can, in theory, perform any computation given enough memory and time. This means it can be used for general programming tasks, not just printing.

### **6. History and Development**
- Developed by **Adobe Systems** between **1982 and 1984**.
- Created by **John Warnock, Charles Geschke, Doug Brotz, Ed Taft, and Bill Paxton**.
- The latest version, **PostScript 3**, was released in **1997** and added better performance, color management, and image compression.
