## What Is WebVTT?

**WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks Format)** is a **text-based subtitle format** used to add timed text tracks to videos. It is the official format supported by HTML5 through the `<track>` element, allowing you to add:

* Subtitles (translated speech)
* Captions (speech and sound effects)
* Descriptions (visual information for screen readers)
* Chapters (navigable points in the video)
* Metadata

### Example of a WebVTT File:

```vtt
WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to our tutorial on WebVTT.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video, you'll learn how to add subtitles to your HTML5 videos.
```

Search engines can’t “watch” your video—but they can read **text-based content**. By using WebVTT files, you add **indexable text** that:

* **Improves discoverability**: Google can index captions and transcripts, making your videos appear in more search results.
* **Increases engagement**: Subtitled videos keep users engaged longer—boosting session duration and reducing bounce rates.
* **Enhances accessibility**: Captioning is essential for users who are deaf or hard of hearing, and it's favored in SEO ranking algorithms.

When a WebVTT file is associated with a video on a webpage, **Google can parse and understand that timed text**, making the content more relevant for certain queries.

## How to Add WebVTT to an HTML5 Video

You can include a WebVTT file in your video using the `<track>` element:

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="subtitles.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

* `src`: Path to your `.vtt` file
* `kind`: Type of text track (`subtitles`, `captions`, `chapters`, etc.)
* `srclang`: Language code (e.g., `en`, `es`)
* `label`: Track label shown in player
