## What is an APP file?

A .app file on macOS is a special type of directory that contains all of the files necessary to run a specific application, including the executable code, resources, and metadata. The .app extension signals to the operating system that this directory should be treated as a single unit, rather than a collection of separate files, and that it can be launched directly from the Finder or the Dock.

Finder is the default file manager application on macOS. It allows you to browse and organize the files and directories on your computer. The Dock is a feature of macOS that provides quick access to frequently used applications and documents. Both Finder and the Dock allow you to launch applications by clicking on their .app files, which will open the corresponding application bundle. When you launch an application, the executable code within the .app bundle is run, making the application available for use. The .app file is the representation of the application on the file system, and provides a way for the user to access and launch the application.

When you right-click on an .app file in Finder on a macOS system and select "Show Package Contents", you'll be able to see the internal structure of the application bundle. This is useful if you want to access resources or files used by the application, or if you want to inspect the contents of the application for troubleshooting purposes. The package contents of an .app file typically include directories for resources such as images and sounds, as well as the executable code for the application. By exploring the contents of an .app file, you can gain deeper insights into how the application is put together and what it does.
