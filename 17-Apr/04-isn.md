## What is an ISN file?

ISN refers to "Installer Source File" and it is a file format commonly used for software installation packages on Windows operating systems. An ISN file contains all the necessary files and instructions needed to install a program or application on computer. Developers create ISN files with software development tools and can share them with users via different channels including physical media, network shares or the internet. Upon running ISN file, a wizard appears that assists users in installing software by offering various options, such as selecting installation preferences, specifying installation directories and configuring necessary settings.

ISN files can be created using a variety of software development tools, such as InstallShield, Wise Package Studio and Advanced Installer. These tools provide range of features for customizing the installation process, including adding custom graphics, creating shortcuts and configuring system settings.

## Installation Process of ISN file

When an ISN file is executed, it typically launches an installation wizard that guides user through the installation process. The wizard may prompt user to accept the software license agreement, select installation options, specify installation locations and configure any necessary settings. The installation wizard will typically provide series of screens or dialog boxes that present the user with options and choices related to the installation process. The wizard may also display progress bars or other indicators to show the user how far along the installation process is.

Depending on complexity of the software being installed, installation wizard may also prompt user to enter additional information or perform additional tasks, such as providing login credentials, specifying database settings or configuring network connections. Once user has made all the necessary selections, wizard will begin copying files from the ISN file to user's computer. This process may take several minutes or longer, depending on the size of software package and speed of the user's computer.

After all the files have been copied, the wizard may prompt the user to create desktop shortcuts or start menu entries for the newly installed software. Once the installation is complete, user can launch the software and begin using it.
