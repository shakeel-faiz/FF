## What is a DOWNLOADING file?

A ".downloading" file is a placeholder file created by Pando when file is being downloaded. It is used to indicate that download process is in progress and is not yet complete. Once download is complete, Pando will automatically rename the ".downloading" file to actual filename of the downloaded file. However, if the download is interrupted or incomplete, ".downloading" file may remain and indicate that the download was not successful.

You can use Pando to download multiple files simultaneously. Each file will have its own ".downloading" placeholder file that indicates progress of its respective download. Pando is designed to allow users to share and download large files, including multiple files at once. The software uses peer-to-peer file sharing technology, which allows for faster and more efficient downloads than traditional download methods. When you initiate a download for multiple files using Pando, each file will have its own progress bar and will be shown as a separate download in Pando download manager. As each file is downloaded, its respective ".downloading" placeholder file will be replaced by actual file with its original filename.

## How can I open or access ".downloading" file created by Pando?

You cannot open or access a ".downloading" file created by Pando directly, as it is not a complete file. Rather, it is a placeholder file that indicates that download process is in progress and has not yet been completed. Once download is complete, Pando will automatically rename ".downloading" file to actual filename of the downloaded file. At this point, you should be able to access file like you would with any other file on your computer.

If the download process is interrupted or incomplete, ".downloading" file may remain in your downloads folder, but it will not be usable or accessible as complete file. In this case, you may need to restart the download process or try downloading file again to ensure that it is fully downloaded and accessible.

## Can I delete a ".downloading" file created by Pando?

Yes, you can delete a ".downloading" file created by Pando. In fact, if Pando download is interrupted or incomplete, it is recommended that you delete ".downloading" file to ensure that you have a clean slate for starting download process again.

To delete a ".downloading" file, simply locate the file in your downloads folder or the folder where download was being saved. Right-click on file and select "Delete" or "Move to Trash" (depending on your operating system), or drag file to the Trash or Recycle Bin

## What is the typical duration for Pando to finish a download and rename the corresponding ".downloading" file?

The time it takes for Pando to complete download and rename ".downloading" file can vary depending on number of factors, including size of the file, speed of your internet connection and the availability of seeders.

Pando is designed to provide fast and efficient file transfers, and the software uses peer-to-peer technology to optimize download speeds. However, actual download time can vary greatly depending on file size, number of seeders and other factors.

In general, smaller files with a good number of seeders may complete download process in just few minutes. Larger files or files with fewer seeders, may take significantly longer to download.

If you are experiencing slow download speeds or are unsure how long your download will take, you can check progress of the download in Pando download manager. The progress bar will indicate how much of file has been downloaded, and you can estimate the remaining time based on your internet connection speed and the download size.
