## What is a CAF file?

A .CAF file, short for **"Core Audio Format,"** is a type of audio file format developed by Apple Inc. It is designed to store audio data and is commonly used on macOS and iOS devices. Core Audio Format files can contain various types of audio data, including uncompressed audio, as well as compressed audio using codecs like AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) or Apple Lossless.

Key characteristics and features of **.caf** files include:

1. **High-Quality Audio:** .caf files can store high-quality audio data, making them suitable for professional audio applications.

2. **Flexibility:** They support both compressed and uncompressed audio, allowing users to choose the level of audio quality and file size that best suits their needs.

3. **Metadata Support:** .caf files can include metadata information about the audio, such as track titles, artist names, and album information.

4. **Multi-Channel Audio:** .caf files support multi-channel audio, making them suitable for surround sound and other multi-channel audio formats.

One notable advantage of CAF files is that they don't impose the 4GB size limitation that you might encounter with some other audio formats like [AIFF](/audio/aiff/) or [WAV](/audio/wav/). This means CAF files can accommodate larger audio files without the need for splitting them into multiple smaller files. Additionally, they have the flexibility to handle any number of audio channels, making them suitable for audio recordings with multiple audio streams or complex channel configurations.
