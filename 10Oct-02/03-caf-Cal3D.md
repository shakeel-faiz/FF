## What is a CAF file?

A .CAF file typically refers to a **"Cal3D Binary Animation File."** Cal3D is an open-source 3D character animation library often used in video game development and other interactive 3D applications. These ".caf" files are specifically designed to store binary animation data for characters or objects created using the Cal3D framework.

## Cal3D Binary Animation File

Here is some information about what you might find in a Cal3D Binary Animation File:

1. **Animation Data:** .caf files primarily contain animation data, such as skeletal animations, keyframes, bone transformations, and other information related to character or object animations.

2. **Skeletal Information:** Cal3D animations are typically based on a skeletal hierarchy, where bones are used to deform the character's mesh. The .caf file stores information about the bone hierarchy and transformations for each keyframe.

3. **Keyframes:** Animation in Cal3D is typically stored as a series of keyframes. The .caf file will contain data for each keyframe, including the positions and orientations of bones at those keyframes.

4. **Blend Weights and Poses:** In more advanced animations, .caf files may also contain information about blending different animations together and defining different poses for characters.

5. **Compression:** To reduce file size and optimize performance, .caf files may employ compression techniques to store animation data efficiently.
