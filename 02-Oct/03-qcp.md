3.  Common in older mobile phone systems, particularly those that use CDMA technology. It's used for voicemail, voice notes, and other voice-based features.
4.  To reduce the data size, QCP files have a lower bitrate, making them ideal for devices with limited storage or for transmitting over networks with limited bandwidth.
5.  These files may not be easily playable on all devices but can be opened with specific audio players or converted to more widely-used formats like MP3 or WAV using conversion tools.
6.  Often identified with the MIME type `audio/qcp`.
