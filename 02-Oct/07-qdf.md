    -   You can also export to **QIF** (Quicken Interchange Format) for older versions or data transfer to other software.
4.  **Save the File**: After selecting the format, choose a location to save the exported file.
    

**Conversion Alternatives:**

-   **Convert to Excel/CSV**: By exporting your data to CSV or Excel-compatible formats, you can open it in programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
