## What is an SB3 file?

The SB3 file format is used by Scratch 3.0, a popular visual programming language designed for educational purposes. Scratch allows users to create interactive stories, animations, and games using blocks of code. The .sb3 file itself stores all the project's assets, such as sprites, sounds, and scripts. It's essentially a compressed file, and if you unzip it, youâ€™ll find a collection of JSON and media files that define the Scratch project.

## How to create SB3 file

Creating an `.sb3` file is simple if you use the Scratch 3.0 interface. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Access Scratch 3.0**

-   Go to the [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and sign in or create an account if you don't already have one.
-   Alternatively, you can download the Scratch Desktop app for offline use from the same website.

2. **Start a New Project**

-   Once logged in, click on the "Create" button at the top of the page to start a new project.
-   You will see the Scratch editor, where you can add sprites, backgrounds, and scripts using blocks.

3. **Build Your Project**

-   Add sprites (characters), backgrounds, and sounds by clicking the respective icons at the bottom of the editor.
-   Use the blocks in the "Code" tab to create interactions and animations. You can drag and drop blocks to make your characters move, speak, or respond to events.

4. **Save the Project**

-   Once you're happy with your project, click on the "File" menu at the top left of the screen.
-   Select "Save now" to save your project online (it will automatically be saved as `.sb3` format on the Scratch website).

If you're using the Scratch Desktop, your project will also be saved locally as an `.sb3` file.

5. **Download the `.sb3` File**

-   To download the `.sb3` file, click on the "File" menu and select "Download to your computer." This will save the project as a `.sb3` file, which you can later open in Scratch for further editing or sharing.

## How to open SB3 file

To open an `.sb3` file, follow these steps:

1. **Using Scratch Online:**

-   Go to the [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
-   Log in to your account.
-   Click "Create" to open the editor.
-   In the editor, click "File" > "Load from your computer" and select your `.sb3` file. The project will load for editing.

2. **Using Scratch Desktop:**

-   Open the Scratch Desktop app.
-   Click "File" > "Load from your computer" and choose the `.sb3` file from your local storage.
