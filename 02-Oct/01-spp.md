What is an SPP file?

The SPP file format is associated with **Serif PhotoPlus**, a discontinued photo editing software developed by Serif. Files with the `.spp` extension are **Serif PhotoPlus Picture Files**, and they store images in a proprietary format. These files often include layers, effects, and other editing information that allow users to continue editing the image without losing quality or important details.

The key features of SPP files include

1.  **Layered Editing**: `.spp` files support layers, allowing users to manage different elements of an image separately.
2.  **Non-destructive Editing**: Changes made to the image can be reversed or altered without affecting the original content.
3.  **Effects and Adjustments**: Users can apply effects, filters, and adjustments to the image while retaining the ability to edit these effects later.

## How to open SPP file

-   **Serif PhotoPlus** is the native software for opening and editing `.spp` files. However, as it has been discontinued, finding the software might be difficult.
-   **Alternative Options**: There are limited options to directly open SPP files in other programs, but you may convert `.spp` files into more common formats like `.jpg` or `.png` within PhotoPlus before transitioning to another editor.

**Note:**
If you're looking for a new photo editing tool to replace PhotoPlus, you might consider software like **GIMP** or **Adobe Photoshop**, though these programs won't directly support `.spp` files.
