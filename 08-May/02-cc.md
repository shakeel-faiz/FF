## What is a CC file?

A CC file is a type of source code file that contains code written in C++ programming language. It can either contain all the code necessary for single program or part of the code that is part of larger programming project which consists of multiple CC files. To modify or view the code contained in CC file, developers often use a source code editor. After editing, they compile the code using compiler to convert it into machine code, which the computer's operating system can execute to run the program.

## CC File Format - More Information

The .cc file extension has been used for C++ source code files for several decades. C++ language was developed in late 1970s by Bjarne Stroustrup who was working at Bell Labs at that time. Stroustrup wanted to extend C programming language with support for object-oriented programming concepts which he felt were essential for building large software systems.

The first version of C++ was released in 1983 and it quickly gained popularity among developers who appreciated its powerful features and flexibility. As C++ became more widely used, it became necessary to establish coding conventions and file naming conventions to help organize and manage large code bases.

Google's C++ Style Guide which recommends using .cc file extension for C++ source code files, was first published in 2003. Since then the guide has been updated periodically to reflect changes in C++ language and development practices of wider programming community.

Today, the .cc file extension remains popular choice for C++ source code files and it is recognized by many popular development tools and platforms.

## How to open CC file?

Many source code editors, including multi-platform tools like Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Code Blocks, can be used to open and edit CC files. These editors offer useful features such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion, making them an excellent choice for working with CC files.

You can also open CC files using any text editor e.g. Notepad, Notepad++ etc.

## Compiling CC with C++ Compilers

Compiling CC file with C++ compiler involves several steps. The first step is to install compatible C++ compiler for your operating system and development environment. There are many different compilers available including GCC, Clang and Microsoft Visual C++.

Once you have C++ compiler installed, the next step is to open terminal or command prompt and navigate to directory where the CC file is located. From here, you can run the compiler by executing a command-line tool provided by the compiler. The specific command to compile CC file may vary depending on compiler you are using. As an example, to compile CC file using GCC, you would run a command similar to:

```
g++ -o myprogram myfile.cc
```
