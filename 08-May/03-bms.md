## What is a BMS file?

A .bms file is a script file used by the QuickBMS tool. QuickBMS uses these script files to define how it should extract or decompress data from specific file or archive format. QuickBMS is a file extraction and conversion tool that can handle wide variety of file formats including archives, disk images, game data and more.

A .bms script file contains series of commands and functions that instruct QuickBMS on how to interpret and extract data from given file. These commands can include things like defining variables, specifying file offsets and lengths and defining data structures. The BMS script also includes instructions for handling compression, encryption and other file format-specific operations.

The purpose of .bms file is to provide way to automate process of extracting or decompressing data from file or archive format. Instead of manually performing these operations, you can write script that defines steps and let QuickBMS handle the details. This can be particularly useful when working with large or complex file formats that would be difficult to handle manually.
