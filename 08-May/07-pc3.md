## What is a PC3 file?

A PC3 file in AutoCAD is a Plotter Configuration file that contains printer or plotter settings for use in software.

When you create new plotter configuration, AutoCAD stores all the necessary information about printer or plotter in PC3 file. This includes things like paper sizes, margins, resolution and other settings specific to the printer or plotter you are using.

You can use PC3 file to easily set up and configure a printer or plotter in AutoCAD. To use PC3 file, simply select it from list of available plotter configurations in the Plot dialog box.

You can also create custom PC3 files by modifying the settings of existing PC3 file or by creating new PC3 file from scratch using the Plotter Manager in AutoCAD.

## How to create PC3 file in AutoCAD?

To create plotter configuration file (PC3) in AutoCAD, follow these steps:

1. **Open Plotter Manager:** Type "PLOTTERMANAGER" in command line or go to "Output" tab on the ribbon and select "Plotter Manager" from "Plot" panel.
2. **Click on "Add-A-Plotter Wizard":** This will launch a wizard that will guide you through the process of creating new plotter configuration file.
3. **Select plotter manufacturer and model:** The wizard will prompt you to select the manufacturer and model of your printer or plotter from list. If your printer or plotter is not listed, you can select "My Computer" and browse for driver file.
4. **Choose a port:** Select the port that your printer or plotter is connected to. If you are unsure, check documentation that came with your printer or plotter.
5. **Specify plotter configuration:** The wizard will prompt you to specify various settings for your plotter such as paper size, resolution and color depth. Make sure to set these options correctly for your specific printer or plotter.
6. **Save plotter configuration:** Once you have specified all the settings, the wizard will prompt you to give your new plotter configuration a name. This will create new PC3 file in the folder specified by wizard.
7. **Use the new plotter configuration:** To use the new plotter configuration in AutoCAD, go to the "Plot" dialog box, select your new plotter configuration from the list of available plotter configurations, and then set up your plot as usual.

That's it! You have now created a new plotter configuration file (PC3) in AutoCAD that you can use for printing or plotting your drawings.

## What is the format of PC3 file?

The PC3 file format is a proprietary file format used by Autodesk's AutoCAD software. It contains configuration settings for specific plotter or printer, including paper size, color depth, resolution and other options.

The PC3 file is typically stored in "Plotter Configuration" folder in AutoCAD installation directory and it can be easily shared between users or computers to ensure consistent printing and plotting settings.

The PC3 file is essentially a text file that contains XML data, which is a machine-readable format for storing and exchanging data. You can view and edit contents of PC3 file using text editor or XML editor, but it is recommended that you use the Plotter Manager in AutoCAD to make changes to plotter configuration, as this will ensure that settings are correctly formatted and compatible with software.

## What does PC3 file contain?

A PC3 file in AutoCAD contains printer or plotter configuration settings that are specific to particular device or driver. These settings are used by AutoCAD to print or plot your drawings accurately and to ensure that they look the way you intended.

Here are some of the settings that can be stored in a PC3 file:

- **Paper size:** This specifies the size of paper that will be used for printing or plotting, such as A4, Letter or Custom.
- **Plot area:** This specifies the portion of drawing that will be plotted, such as the entire layout or just a specific window.
- **Plot scale:** This specifies scale at which drawing will be printed or plotted, such as 1:100 or 1/4"=1'-0".
- **Line weight:** This specifies thickness of lines in drawing, which affects how they will look when printed or plotted.
- **Color depth:** This specifies number of colors that will be used for printing or plotting, such as black and white or full color.
- **Resolution:** This specifies resolution at which drawing will be printed or plotted, which affects how sharp and detailed it will look.
- **Other options:** There are many other options that can be set in PC3 file, such as print quality, orientation, margins, shading and more.

By creating and using PC3 file that contains correct settings for your specific printer or plotter, you can ensure that your drawings are printed or plotted accurately and with consistent quality.
