What is a MLX file?
MLX file is a type of file format used in MATLAB, a programming language and computing environment for numerical computation and data analysis. The MLX file format is used for MATLAB Live Scripts, which combine text, code and visualizations in single interactive document.

MATLAB Live Scripts allow users to create executable documents that can be shared with others and provide interactive way to explore data and algorithms. They are similar to Jupyter Notebooks in that they allow for mix of code, text and visualizations but they are specific to MATLAB.

MLX files can be opened and edited using MATLAB or MATLAB Online which is web-based version of software. They can also be exported to other file formats such as PDF or HTML for sharing with others who may not have access to MATLAB.
