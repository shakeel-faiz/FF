## What is a GMA file?

The **GMA file format** is primarily associated with **Garry's Mod**, a sandbox video game that allows users to manipulate objects and create their own game modes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the .gma format entails:

Key features of .gma files include

1.  **Purpose**: GMA files are used for storing game content, such as add-ons, mods, and other custom assets for Garry's Mod.
    
2.  **Compression**: The .gma file format is essentially a compressed archive, often using a variation of the ZIP format. This allows multiple files (like models, scripts, and textures) to be packed into a single file for easier distribution and installation.
    
3.  **Contents**: When you extract a .gma file, you typically find various file types, including:
    
    -   **Model files** (e.g., .mdl)
    -   **Texture files** (e.g., .vtf)
    -   **Sound files** (e.g., .wav)
    -   **Lua scripts** (for custom game logic)
4.  **Creation and Usage**: Users can create .gma files using the Garry's Mod Addon tool, which facilitates packaging custom content for sharing within the community. Players can then install these add-ons by placing the .gma files in the appropriate directory.
    
5.  **Compatibility**: While .gma files are specific to Garry's Mod, they may also be used in other Source engine games, as Garry's Mod is built on the Source engine.
