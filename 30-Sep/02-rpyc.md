## What is an RPYC file?

An **RPYC file** is a compiled script file generated by Ren'Py from its original **.rpy** files. These `.rpy` files contain the game scripts written using Ren'Py's unique scripting language, which is similar to Python. When a game is run, the Ren'Py engine compiles the `.rpy` files into RPYC files, optimizing performance and enhancing security. 

Key characteristics of RPYC files include

1.  **Compiled Format**: RPYC files are compiled versions of the source scripts, which means they contain the code in a form that the Ren'Py engine can execute more efficiently.
    
2.  **Obfuscation**: One of the primary purposes of the RPYC format is to obfuscate the original code. This makes it difficult for users to read or modify the game scripts directly, adding a layer of protection for developers.
    
3.  **Automatic Generation**: Each time a Ren'Py game is launched, the engine checks for any updated `.rpy` scripts and generates the corresponding RPYC files. If no changes are detected, it uses the existing RPYC files.
    
4.  **Deleting RPY Files**: Once the RPYC files are generated, developers can delete the original `.rpy` files if they choose, although it is generally advisable to keep them for future updates or modifications.

## How RPYC Files Work

The process of compiling `.rpy` files into RPYC files involves several steps:

1.  **Writing the Game Script**: Developers write their game scripts in `.rpy` format, utilizing Ren'Py’s scripting syntax along with Python-like statements to control the flow of the game.
    
2.  **Running the Game**: When the game is launched, Ren'Py checks the `game` directory for any changes in the `.rpy` files.
    
3.  **Compilation Process**: If changes are detected or if it's the first run, Ren'Py compiles the `.rpy` scripts into RPYC files. This involves translating the high-level scripting language into a format that the engine can execute efficiently.
    
4.  **Execution**: The game runs using the generated RPYC files. This compilation allows for faster loading times and smoother gameplay, as the engine does not need to interpret the original script files each time.
    
## The Transition to RPYB Format

With the release of Ren'Py version 5.3.0, the introduction of the **.RPYB** format marked a significant change in how scripts are handled. While RPYC files previously included bytecode for execution, the new RPYB format specifically stores this bytecode, allowing RPYC files to focus solely on the compiled Python script. This separation enhances the efficiency of the game engine and streamlines the compilation process.

## How to open RPYC file

To open an RPYC file, you can follow these methods:

-   **Run in Ren'Py**: Simply run your game project in the Ren'Py engine. It will automatically use the RPYC files during execution.
    
-   **Decompile**: Use a decompiler tool like `renpy-decompiler` to convert the RPYC file back into a human-readable **.rpy** format. You’ll need Python installed for this:
    
```   
python renpy_decompiler.py your_file.rpyc
```
-   If the RPYC file is part of a game package, use archive tools like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the contents, which may include original **.rpy** files.

Programs that can open or handle RPYC files include

- **Ren'Py** (Free) (Windows, Mac, Linux)
