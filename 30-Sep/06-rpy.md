## What is an RPY file?

The `.rpy` file format is primarily associated with **Ren'Py**, a visual novel engine used for creating interactive storytelling games. Here are some key points about the `.rpy` format:

1.  **Script Files**: `.rpy` files contain script code written in a special programming language that Ren'Py uses to define the narrative, character interactions, scenes, and gameplay mechanics.
    
2.  **Text-Based**: These files are plain text files, making them easily editable with any text editor. The code is designed to be user-friendly, allowing writers to focus on storytelling without extensive programming knowledge.
    
3.  **Game Logic**: They can include various elements such as:
    
    -   Dialogue
    -   Choices for players
    -   Background music and sound effects
    -   Character definitions (sprites)
    -   Scene transitions
4.  **Customization**: Users can customize their games extensively by creating multiple `.rpy` files, enabling better organization of code and assets.

**Basic example of RPY file**

Hereâ€™s a simple example of what you might find in a `.rpy` file:

```
define e = Character("Eileen")

label start:
    e "Hello, world!"
    menu:
        "How do you feel?":
            "Happy":
                e "That's great to hear!"
            "Sad":
                e "I'm sorry to hear that."
    return
```

**Usage**

-   **Creating Visual Novels**: Developers use `.rpy` files to write and organize their stories, making it easy to develop complex branching narratives.
-   **Modding**: The Ren'Py community often shares `.rpy` scripts, enabling others to learn from or modify existing works.
