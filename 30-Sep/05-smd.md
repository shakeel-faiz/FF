## What is an SMD file?

The **Valve Studiomdl Data File** (`.smd`) format is primarily used in the development of 3D models for games that run on the Source engine, such as those created by Valve Corporation (e.g., Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source). 

Key Features of the SMD Format include

1.  **Structure**:
    
    -   **Vertices**: Each vertex is defined by its position in 3D space (x, y, z coordinates).
    -   **Normals**: Information about the surface normal for lighting calculations.
    -   **Texture Coordinates**: Specifies how textures are mapped onto the surface of the model.
    -   **Triangles**: Defines how vertices connect to form triangles, which make up the model's mesh.
2.  **File Format**:
    
    -   The `.smd` file is a plain text file, making it readable and editable in any text editor.
    -   It generally includes sections for mesh data and bone data, if applicable.
3.  **Usage**:
    
    -   **Exporting Models**: Often used as an intermediate format when exporting models from 3D modeling software (like Blender or 3ds Max) to the Source engine.
    -   **Animation**: SMD files can also store skeletal animation data, linking vertex movements to bones in a rig.
4.  **Compiling**:
    
    -   SMD files are typically compiled into a format that the Source engine can use (such as `.mdl` files) using a tool called **Studiomdl**. The process often involves a `.qc` (Quake Compile) file, which specifies how the SMD files should be compiled into a final model.
