### What is an SVS file?

An **SVS file** (Slide and Viewable Storage) is a digital slide image file commonly created by **Aperio ScanScope** slide scanners. Designed for the medical and research fields, SVS files store a series of **TIFF images** that represent various views of a specimen slide.

Key characteristics of SVS files include:

1.  **Multi-Resolution Storage**: SVS files contain multiple images at different resolutions. This structure allows for efficient viewing, enabling users to zoom in on high-resolution details or navigate using lower-resolution images.
    
2.  **Baseline Image**: The first image in an SVS file is the baseline specimen image saved at full resolution. This image is tiled, typically using a tile size of **240 x 240 pixels**.
    
3.  **Thumbnail Image**: The second image is a thumbnail, usually sized at **1024 x 768 pixels**. This smaller image provides a quick overview for easier navigation.
    
4.  **Pyramid Images**: Following the baseline and thumbnail images, SVS files may include additional pyramid images saved at various resolutions, facilitating smooth zooming and panning.
    
5.  **Slide Label Image**: Many SVS files also contain a slide label image that identifies the physical slide the file was created from. This helps link the digital images with their corresponding physical specimens, ensuring accurate analysis.
    
6.  **Metadata**: SVS files can store extensive metadata about the specimen, such as identification numbers, staining methods, and other pertinent details that enhance analysis and research.

## What is Aperio ScanScope

**Aperio ScanScope** is a digital slide scanner developed by Aperio Technologies, now part of Leica Biosystems. It captures high-resolution images of biological specimens on glass slides, facilitating efficient analysis in pathology and research.

The scanners utilize multi-resolution imaging, saving images in the **SVS (Slide and Viewable Storage)** format, which stores multiple resolutions and associated metadata. They automate slide loading and scanning, enhancing workflow efficiency.

Integrated with software like **Aperio ImageScope**, users can view and annotate slides, while telepathology capabilities allow remote sharing for collaboration. Overall, Aperio ScanScope scanners modernize pathology by transforming glass slides into accessible digital formats.

## How to open an SVS file

Opening SVS files requires specialized software designed for handling digital slide images. Here are some commonly used applications that can open SVS files:

1.  **Aperio ImageScope**: This software is specifically designed for viewing SVS files and provides various tools for annotation, measurement, and analysis of digital slides. Itâ€™s widely used in clinical and research settings.
    
2.  **QuPath**: An open-source software for bioimage analysis that supports SVS files. QuPath offers powerful tools for image analysis and visualization, making it a popular choice among researchers.
    
3.  **OpenSlide**: This library allows developers to access SVS files programmatically. It also includes various viewer applications for opening SVS images.
    
4.  **PathViewer**: A user-friendly application that supports the viewing of SVS files, PathViewer allows for easy navigation and examination of digital slides.
    
5.  **ImageJ/Fiji**: These powerful image analysis tools can open SVS files with the appropriate plugins. They are commonly used in research for processing and analyzing scientific images.

Programs that can open or handle SVS files include
