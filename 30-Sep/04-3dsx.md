## What is a 3DSX file?

The **.3dsx file format** is primarily used for homebrew applications on the Nintendo 3DS, allowing users to run unofficial software on the console. Essentially, .3dsx files are ZIP archives that contain the necessary components to execute these applications, typically including executable code, resources, and metadata about the application. To run .3dsx files, users simply place them in a specific directory on their SD card and utilize a compatible homebrew launcher.

Key characteristics of 3DSX files include:

-   **Executable Code**: .3dsx files contain executable code that allows them to run unofficial applications on the 3DS.
-   **Homebrew Launcher**: To open a .3dsx file, you need a homebrew launcher installed on your device. This launcher serves as a gateway to run various homebrew applications, including games, utilities, and emulators.
-   **Supported Exploits**: .3dsx files are typically opened through Nintendo 3DS software exploits, such as **soundhax** and **browserhax**. These exploits allow players to access the homebrew launcher and run .3dsx applications.

**Common Uses**

The homebrew launcher and .3dsx files empower users to engage in a variety of activities on their 3DS. One popular use is playing retro games, as many users employ homebrew to enjoy older titles from consoles like the Super Nintendo. Additionally, homebrew applications can bypass regional restrictions, enabling players to access games that may not be available in their region. The homebrew community has also developed a diverse range of custom applications, including file managers and system utilities, further enhancing the overall gaming experience.

**Notable Filename**

-   **boot.3dsx**: This is the file used to launch the homebrew launcher itself. It should be placed at the root of your 3DS's SD card for the homebrew launcher to function properly.
