## What is a 3DSX file?

The **.3dsx file format** is primarily used for homebrew applications on the Nintendo 3DS, allowing users to run unofficial software on the console. Essentially, .3dsx files are ZIP archives that contain the necessary components to execute these applications, typically including executable code, resources, and metadata about the application. To run .3dsx files, users simply place them in a specific directory on their SD card and utilize a compatible homebrew launcher.

**Common Uses**

The homebrew launcher and .3dsx files empower users to engage in a variety of activities on their 3DS. One popular use is playing retro games, as many users employ homebrew to enjoy older titles from consoles like the Super Nintendo. Additionally, homebrew applications can bypass regional restrictions, enabling players to access games that may not be available in their region. The homebrew community has also developed a diverse range of custom applications, including file managers and system utilities, further enhancing the overall gaming experience.
