## What is a PKF file?

The PKF file format is commonly associated with Adobe Audition, a professional audio editing software. It stands for "Peak" file, and it is generated by Audition to store information about audio peak levels. This information is used for various purposes, including waveform display, audio editing, and processing.

## PKF File Format - More Information

When you import audio files into Adobe Audition, it analyzes the audio and generates corresponding **.pkf files** alongside the original audio files. These .pkf files contain data about the maximum peak levels of the audio waveform, allowing Audition to quickly redraw the waveform display without repeatedly analyzing the audio file.

PKF files are usually stored in the same directory as the corresponding audio files and have the same filename, with the ".pkf" extension appended to it.
