## What is an XMDX file?

An XMDX file, used by ExamSoft's SofTest, contains the finalized version of an exam, including the answers provided by the exam taker. These files are generated by the ExamSoft software after the completion of an exam.

If you have an XMDX file and you need to review or manage the exam data within it, you will typically need ExamSoft's software to open and work with it. SofTest is the primary application used for taking exams administered through ExamSoft, and it is also used for reviewing exams after they've been completed.
