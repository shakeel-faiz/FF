## WHat is a BPS file?

A .BPS file is essentially a backup of a word processing document created with Microsoft Works, which typically uses the .WPS file extension for its documents. These .BPS files are often generated automatically by Microsoft Works as a precaution in case the program crashes while you're working on a document. It is a way to safeguard your work and prevent data loss.

- **Calendar and Address Book:** In addition to the core office applications, Microsoft Works often included tools for managing calendars and address books.

- **Works Word Processor Format (.WPS):** The native file format of the word processing component of Microsoft Works. .WPS files contained text, formatting, and simple graphics.
