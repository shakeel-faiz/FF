## What is a BPS file?

A ".bps" file extension typically refers to a Binary Patch File. These files are used to apply patches or updates to existing files or software. Here is some more information about BPS files:

1. **Patch Files:** BPS files contain binary data that represents the changes needed to update or modify an existing file or program. Instead of replacing the entire file, patch files only include the differences between the original file and the updated version.

2. **ROM Hacking:** BPS files are commonly used in the context of ROM hacking. ROM hackers use BPS files to distribute patches that modify the game code or content in classic video game ROMs. Players can apply these patches to their game ROMs to experience fan-made modifications and translations.

3. **Patch Application:** To apply a BPS patch, you'll need a patching tool. Popular patching utilities like "Floating IPS" or "Beat" allow you to apply BPS patches to the corresponding ROM file, creating a modified version of the game or software.

## Softwares Linked to BPS

In the following sections, we will explore the software applications associated with BPS files.

## Floating IPS

Floating IPS (Flips) is a popular and user-friendly utility for applying patches to ROM files in the context of ROM hacking. It is commonly used in the emulation and fan translation communities.

- **Patch Application:** Floating IPS is designed to apply patch files, typically in the BPS format, to ROM files. These patches contain binary data that represent changes to the original ROM, such as translations, bug fixes, or gameplay modifications.

- **Automatic Patching:** Floating IPS automatically detects the target ROM's header and applies the patch accordingly, simplifying the patching process.

- **Checksum Verification:** The tool often includes a checksum verification feature to ensure the integrity of the patched ROM, reducing the risk of errors or corruption.

- **Patch Creation:** While Floating IPS is primarily used for applying patches, it can also be used to create patch files (BPS format) from the differences between two ROMs, making it useful for ROM hacking and translation projects.

## MultiPatch

MultiPatch is another utility commonly used in the ROM hacking community, specifically for applying patches to ROM files. It is similar in function to Floating IPS but comes with its own features and interface. Some more information related to it.

- **Patch Application:** MultiPatch is designed to apply patches to ROM files, typically in formats like IPS, UPS, or BPS. These patches contain binary data that modify the original ROM, often for purposes like translations, bug fixes, or customizations.

- **Support for Various Patch Formats:** It supports a range of patch file formats, including IPS (International Patching System), UPS (Universal Patch Format), and BPS (Binary Patch System), making it versatile for different types of patches.

- **Batch Patching:** MultiPatch can be used to apply multiple patches to a single ROM file or to multiple ROM files at once, which is helpful for complex ROM hacks or projects involving multiple patches.

- **Patch Creation:** Similar to Floating IPS, MultiPatch can also be used to create patch files from the differences between two ROMs, which is useful for ROM hacking and translation projects.
