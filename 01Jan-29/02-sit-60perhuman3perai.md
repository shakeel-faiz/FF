## What is a SIT file?

SIT files format are associated with **StuffIt**, a file compression and archiving utility developed by Aladdin Systems (now owned by Smith Micro Software). The SIT file format is used for creating StuffIt archives, which are compressed and archived files. SIT file archives are similar to other archive formats, such as .zip or .rar, but they use the .sit extension.

SIT file archives can contain one or more files and folders that have been compressed to reduce their size for storage or transmission. These archives may include various types of files, such as documents, images, or applications.

## How to open SIT files on MAC?

MAC OS includes built-in support for extracting SIT files, and you don't necessarily need additional software. Find the .sit file that you want to extract on your Mac. In most cases, you can simply double-click on the .sit file. macOS should recognize the StuffIt format and automatically use the built-in Archive Utility to extract the contents. The extracted files and folders will be placed in the same directory as the original .sit file.
