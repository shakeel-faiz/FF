## What is a DSV file?

A DSV file is a saved game file created by DeSmuME, a Nintendo DS emulator. It essentially stores a player's progress up to the last time they used a game's in-game Save feature. DeSmuMe is an open-source Nintendo DS emulator available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It enables players to play Nintendo DS games on their PCs.

DeSmuME players usually save their game progress in .DST files. These save state files can be created conveniently from DeSmuME's menu at any point during gameplay. This flexibility allows players to save their progress at any time, not just at in-game save points.

## DSV Files vs DST Files:

While .DST files are the primary choice for saving game progress, DeSmuME players can also use DSV files. DSV files specifically store a player's progress only up to their last in-game save. The motivation behind saving progress as DSV files is to facilitate the transfer of progress to another Nintendo DS emulator. The DSV format is nearly identical to the SAV format, which is used by many other emulators.

## Converting DSV to SAV

Converting a DSV file to a SAV file involves changing the file extension, as the content and structure of the two file types are generally similar. Both DSV and SAV files are used to store saved game progress in emulators.

Find the DSV file that you want to convert. It may be in the folder where DeSmuME saves its game files. Change the file extension from ".dsv" to ".sav". 

## Converting SAV to DSV

Find the SAV file that you want to convert. It may be in the folder where the emulator (e.g., DeSmuME) saves its game files. Change the file extension from ".sav" to ".dsv."
