## What is an NSZ file?

NSZ files are compressed versions of Nintendo Switch game files, often used to reduce the file size for more efficient storage and distribution. NSZ files are typically created using tools that compress and package Nintendo Switch games into a smaller size without losing any game data. This compression is similar to the more common ".nsp" file format used for Nintendo Switch games.

## NSZ Yuzu

Yuzu is a Nintendo Switch emulator for PC. It allows users to play Nintendo Switch games on their computers. The ".nsz" file extension is associated with compressed Nintendo Switch game files. To reduce file sizes and make them more manageable, users might choose to compress these game files using tools that create NSZ files. Users then use the Yuzu emulator to play Nintendo Switch games on their PC. The emulator is designed to run these game files, including the compressed NSZ versions. Yuzu may have features to handle the decompression of NSZ files during the game loading process, allowing users to play the compressed games seamlessly.

## Ryujinx NSZ

Ryujinx is another Nintendo Switch emulator for PC, similar to Yuzu. Like Yuzu, Ryujinx allows users to play Nintendo Switch games on their computers. Users acquire Nintendo Switch game files from legal sources, such as game cartridges or digital copies purchased from the official Nintendo eShop. To reduce file sizes and make them more manageable, users might choose to compress these game files using tools that create NSZ files. Users then use the Ryujinx emulator to play Nintendo Switch games on their PC. The emulator is designed to run these game files, including the compressed NSZ versions. Ryujinx have features to handle the decompression of NSZ files during the game loading process, allowing users to play the compressed games seamlessly.

## NSP vs NSZ

NSP and NSZ are both file formats associated with Nintendo Switch games. NSP files are the standard format for Nintendo Switch game files. They are essentially the raw, uncompressed files. NSZ files are compressed versions of Nintendo Switch game files. They are essentially NSP files that have undergone compression to reduce their size.

When choosing between NSP and NSZ, it often comes down to a balance between file size and loading times. If storage space is a concern, using NSZ files can help save disk space. However, if faster loading times are a priority, NSP files might be preferred.
