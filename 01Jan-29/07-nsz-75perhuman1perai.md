## What is an NSZ file?

NSZ files are compressed versions of Nintendo Switch game files, often used to reduce the file size for more efficient storage and distribution. NSZ files are typically created using tools that compress and package Nintendo Switch games into a smaller size without losing any game data. This compression is similar to the more common ".nsp" file format used for Nintendo Switch games.

## NSZ file format - More Information

Players can use custom operating systems and emulators to play games saved as NSP files on their Nintendo Switch or PC. NSP files can be large, making it challenging for players to share them efficiently. To address the issue of large file sizes, members of Nintendo Switch community, developed NSZ file format. The nsz compression program allows Nintendo Switch players to compress large NSP files into smaller NSZ archives. Players can share these compressed NSZ archives with others. Recipients can then use nsz compression program to decompress archives. The result is an NSP file that can be opened or installed. Some custom Switch firmware supports installation of NSZ files without the need for decompression first.

## NSZ Yuzu

Yuzu is a Nintendo Switch emulator for PC. It allows users to play Nintendo Switch games on their computers. The ".nsz" file extension is associated with compressed Nintendo Switch game files. To reduce file sizes and make them more manageable, users might choose to compress these game files using tools that create NSZ files. Users then use Yuzu emulator to play Nintendo Switch games on their PC. The emulator is designed to run these game files, including compressed NSZ versions. Yuzu may have features to handle decompression of NSZ files during game loading process, allowing users to play compressed games seamlessly.

## Ryujinx NSZ

Ryujinx is another Nintendo Switch emulator for PC, similar to Yuzu. Like Yuzu, Ryujinx allows users to play Nintendo Switch games on their computers. Users acquire Nintendo Switch game files from legal sources, such as game cartridges or digital copies purchased from official Nintendo eShop. To reduce file sizes and make them more manageable, users might choose to compress these game files using tools that create NSZ files. Users then use Ryujinx emulator to play Nintendo Switch games on their PC. The emulator is designed to run these game files, including compressed NSZ versions. Ryujinx have features to handle decompression of NSZ files during game loading process, allowing users to play compressed games seamlessly.

## NSP vs NSZ

NSP and NSZ are both file formats associated with Nintendo Switch games. NSP files are standard format for Nintendo Switch game files. They are essentially raw, uncompressed files. NSZ files are compressed versions of Nintendo Switch game files. They are essentially NSP files that have undergone compression to reduce their size.

When choosing between NSP and NSZ, it often comes down to a balance between file size and loading times. If storage space is a concern, using NSZ files can help save disk space. However, if faster loading times are a priority, NSP files might be preferred.

## NSZ Switch	

NSZ files use compression algorithms to reduce size of Nintendo Switch game files. This can be particularly useful for storage and distribution, especially when dealing with large game files. NSZ files are often used in conjunction with Nintendo Switch emulators, such as Yuzu and Ryujinx, to play Nintendo Switch games on a computer.
