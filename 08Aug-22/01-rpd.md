## What is an RPD file?

RPD file format is specific to the iTWO application suite used for construction planning and engineering. An RPD file is a database file that stores a Progress ObjectStore Database. This database contains all the data for an iTWO planning project, serving as a backend storage format for the application.

In the iTWO context, the RPD file contains structured information related to construction projects, such as project plans, resources, schedules, budgets, and other project-related data. This format allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of project data within the iTWO application suite.
