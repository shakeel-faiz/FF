## What is an FPT file?

An "Alpha Five Table Memo File" with an .fpt extension is associated with the Alpha Five database software. Alpha Five is a relational database management system that was used to create and manage databases, particularly in small to medium-sized businesses. The .fpt file format is used to store memo fields in a database table.

In the context of databases, a "memo field" typically refers to a field that can hold large amounts of text or binary data, such as lengthy notes, descriptions, or even files like images, documents, or other multimedia. Memo fields are separate from regular fields due to their ability to store more data.

The .fpt file extension stands for "FoxPro Table Memo File." FoxPro was an earlier database management system, and Alpha Five might have adopted or been influenced by its file format for memo fields. These .fpt files are used to store the content of memo fields associated with records in an Alpha Five database table. They can hold various types of data, including plain text, formatted text, images, and even links to external files.
