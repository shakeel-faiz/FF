## What is Homebrew?

Homebrew is a software package management tool that is free and open source. Using this software package, it is easy to install software on Apple OS, macOS, and Linux OS. It is called Homebrew because it is "home-made," meaning it was developed by hobbyists and enthusiasts rather than large companies or official developers. Homebrew was developed by Max Howell, but over time, it became popular within the Ruby on Rails community.

The goal of Homebrew is to simplify the process of installing, updating, and managing software. It allows users to install applications such as command-line tools, libraries, and other software that may not be available in the macOS App Store or Linux repositories. The software installed via Homebrew is usually open source. Homebrew supports various types of development and productivity tools, which relate to different programming languages, frameworks, database systems, and utilities.
