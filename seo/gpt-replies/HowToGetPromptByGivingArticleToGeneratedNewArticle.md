### **1. Characteristics of the Tone**  
#### **a. Friendly Introduction**  
- The article starts by acknowledging the readerâ€™s familiarity with PDFs, making it relatable:  
  *"All of you must be familiar with what PDFs are."*  
- This conversational touch eases readers into the topic.  

#### **b. Clear Definitions and Context**  
- It explains what PDFs are, where they are used, and their importance in straightforward language.  
- Technical terms (e.g., "open standard maintained by ISO") are introduced in a way that blends technical accuracy with easy understanding.  

#### **c. Step-by-Step Approach**  
- The tutorial uses headings, bullet points, and code snippets for clarity.  
- Key concepts are broken into chunks, like:
  - Explaining what the code does in simple terms.  
  - Highlighting specific Python classes like `PdfReader`.  

#### **d. Encourages Hands-On Learning**  
- Invites the reader to try things out, such as installing `pypdf` and running the code.  
- Provides real examples, outputs, and interpretations of the code.

### **2. Why Does It Feel Human?**  
- **Relatable Start:** Engages readers by making the content relatable (e.g., "All of you must be familiar...").  
- **Simple Language:** Avoids unnecessary jargon while explaining technical aspects.  
- **Interactive Style:** Uses rhetorical questions like *"Let us try to understand the above code in chunks."* to encourage engagement.  
- **Focus on Clarity:** Breaks down complex concepts and explains them bit by bit.  
- **Personal Touch:** Offers small advice like *"This module name is case-sensitive, so make sure the y is lowercase and everything else is uppercase."*

2. **For Definitions**  
   - *"Explain the definition of PDF in simple terms for readers who are unfamiliar with technical jargon."*  

3. **For Step-by-Step Instructions**  
   - *"Provide step-by-step instructions on how to use the Python library `pypdf` to extract text from a PDF file, including code examples and their explanations."*  

4. **For a Friendly and Informative Tone**  
   - *"Write an article that explains how to merge PDFs using Python in an informative yet conversational tone, suitable for beginners."*  

5. **For Breaking Down Complex Concepts**  
   - *"Break down the functionality of the `PdfReader` class from the `pypdf` library into easily understandable steps, including examples."*
