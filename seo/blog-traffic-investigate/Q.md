Q10

Yes, writing smaller, more focused articles targeting a **single keyword** could be a **smart strategy**, especially if your main article is ranking lower (position 70). Here's how this approach can work and what to keep in mind:

### **Why Smaller Articles Can Help**
1. **Higher Relevance**: Smaller, focused articles are easier to optimize for a single keyword. This can improve their chances of ranking higher, especially if your main article is too broad or lengthy.
   
2. **Easier to Rank**: Articles targeting a single keyword tend to have less competition, especially if the keyword is niche, which increases the likelihood of higher rankings.

3. **Interlinking for SEO**: By creating smaller articles around related keywords, you can **link them back to your main article**. This creates a network of pages that can help improve the ranking of your main article.

4. **Improved User Experience**: Concise, focused content is often more user-friendly. Visitors looking for a quick answer are more likely to click and stay on a short, straightforward article.

---

### **How to Proceed: Step-by-Step**
1. **Target Specific Keywords**: Choose **one keyword** per article that is relevant to your main topic. For example, you can write an article for:
   - "difference between MKV and MP4"
   - "benefits of using MP4 format"
   - "how to convert MKV to MP4"
   
2. **Create Concise Articles**:
   - Keep the articles **short** and **focused**, directly answering the search query.
   - For example, if your main article is on "MKV vs MP4," you can have smaller articles like:
     - "How to Convert MKV to MP4" (targeting the conversion keyword)
     - "Best Software for Converting MKV to MP4" (targeting software-specific searches)

3. **Optimize for SEO**:
   - Use the **target keyword** in the title, introduction, and naturally throughout the content.
   - Ensure the article is **well-structured** (with headings and bullet points for readability).
   - Add **internal links** to your main article where relevant. For example, in the "How to Convert MKV to MP4" article, you could link to your "MKV vs MP4" comparison.

4. **Interlinking**:
   - Once the smaller articles are published, link them back to your main article. This helps **distribute page authority** and boosts the ranking potential of your main article.
   - If someone finds one of your smaller articles, they might click through to your main article for further details.

5. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Use **Google Search Console** to track the rankings of your smaller articles. If they start ranking higher for their specific keywords, the authority they pass to your main article could help it climb as well.

---

### **Benefits of the Approach**
- **Higher chances of ranking** for specific, low-competition keywords.
- **Better focus** and **more relevant content** for the target audience.
- **Building topical authority**: A network of smaller articles around a central theme can establish your website as an authority on the subject.

---

### **Important Considerations**
- **Quality over Quantity**: Don’t just write short articles for the sake of having many. Each article should be well-researched and provide real value to the reader.
- **Don’t Duplicate Content**: Make sure each article targets a unique angle or keyword. Avoid overlapping topics that could lead to keyword cannibalization.
- **Update Main Article**: As your smaller articles rank, you can update your main article with links to them, creating a strong content network.

---

### **Example**
If your main article is about the difference between MKV and MP4, here are some additional articles you can write:
- "How to Convert MKV to MP4"
- "MP4 vs MKV for Streaming: Which Is Better?"
- "Top 5 MKV Players for Windows"
- "Why MP4 Is the Best Format for Online Videos"

Each of these articles can rank for specific queries while pointing back to the main comparison article.

---

By following this strategy, you should be able to gradually improve the ranking of both your smaller articles and your main one. Would you like more details on how to structure the smaller articles or how to track keyword performance?

Answer: should i write smaller articles that could rank higher with single keyword and point to my main article.md
