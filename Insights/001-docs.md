Alright â€” let's go deep into this!  
I've looked at your GSC screenshot, and hereâ€™s what your data is telling us:

---

### General Overview:

- **You are ranking for highly generic keywords**, like `docx`, `doc x`, `.docx`, etc.
- These are **high-volume, intent-ambiguous keywords** (people searching could be looking for different things: open, edit, convert, download, etc.).
- Your **CTR ranges from 1.9% to 11%**, which is not bad for these types of keywords.
- The top query `"docx"` alone is bringing a lot of impressions (179k+) but a lower CTR of 2.7%.

### Insights by Query:

| Query             | Impressions | CTR   | Insight |
|------------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| `docx`            | 179,247     | 2.7%  | Huge volume, average CTR. Opportunity to improve title/meta to stand out more. |
| `doc x`           | 3,616       | 11%   | Small volume but strong CTR. You are matching search intent well here. Maybe optimize page for this term too. |
| `.docx`           | 13,230      | 1.9%  | High impressions, lower CTR. Indicates your snippet/title could be improved for this query. |
| `document.docx`   | 1,665       | 4.7%  | Nice CTR for this specific query. Target this more in your content if possible. |
| `word docx`       | 2,467       | 2.8%  | Decent CTR â€” maybe users are looking for Word-specific actions (like convert to Word or edit Word doc). Consider adding relevant CTAs or headings. |
| `doc.x`           | 1,024       | 5.9%  | High CTR for lower impressions. Indicates specific intent, could be worth targeting. |

### Patterns & Recommendations:

1. **Generic keywords need stronger differentiation.**
   - For high impressions, low CTR keywords like `docx` and `.docx`, try improving your title and meta description. Make it action-driven. Example:
     - _"Convert DOCX Files Online - Free & Instant"_  
     - _"Open, Edit & Convert DOCX Documents in Seconds"_

2. **Leverage high-CTR keywords more.**
   - Queries like `doc x`, `doc.x`, and `document.docx` have strong CTRs. Try to create dedicated sections, FAQs, or headings around these variants.

3. **Check Search Intent.**
   - People searching for `.docx` or `docx` might be looking to **convert, open, or understand** the file format.
   - Align your content and titles to these intents. Add schema if possible!

4. **Consider Page Titles / Meta Refresh.**
   - Since most traffic comes from generic file-related queries, your page title is super important.
   - Test variations of meta titles and descriptions to see if you can lift that CTR by even 0.5â€“1% â€” it will bring a lot more clicks at scale.

5. **Watch Impressions/Clicks Over Time.**
   - Track whether impressions are growing but clicks aren't keeping pace. If so, itâ€™s a strong sign to improve your snippet attractiveness.

### Overall:

Youâ€™re in a good position â€” you already have search presence.  
The goal now is to **capture more of the impressions youâ€™re already getting**.

Even a small CTR lift (from 2.7% to 3.5% for `docx`, for example) could mean **hundreds of extra clicks** every month.
