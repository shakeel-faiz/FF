## What is an ASSET file?

An ASSET file is a special file used in Unity, a program for making video games. It holds important configurations like game objects or settings. For example, one ASSET file might store how objects move in the game, like how they bounce off each other or fall down. These files are like containers that keep all the important information organized so that game developers can easily work on their projects.
