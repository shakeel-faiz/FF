## What is an RPF file?

The RPF file is commonly associated with the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) game series, particularly with the PC version. These files are archives that contain various game data, such as models, textures, scripts, and other resources used by the game engine.

In Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), for example, .rpf files are used extensively to organize and store game assets. They are usually found within game's installation directory in "update" or "x64" folders.
