## What is an RPF file?

The RPF file is commonly associated with the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) game series, particularly with the PC version. These files are archives that contain various game data, such as models, textures, scripts, and other resources used by the game engine.

## RPF File Format - More Information

In Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), for example, .rpf files are used extensively to organize and store game assets. They are usually found within the game's installation directory in the "update" or "x64" folders. These files are often encrypted or compressed to protect the game's assets and prevent easy modification by users.

Modding communities often work with .rpf files to create custom content, mods, or tweaks for the game. Tools have been developed to extract, modify, and repack these files, allowing users to customize their GTA experience beyond what the base game offers.
