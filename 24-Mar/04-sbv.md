## What is a SBV file?

A file with the .sbv file extension is a SubViewer subtitle file. SubViewer is a format for subtitles used with video files that originated in the early 2000s. The .sbv file contains the subtitle text along with timing information for when each subtitle should be displayed during the video playback.

SubViewer files are often used with YouTube videos, as YouTube supports the SubViewer format for its video captions. SubViewer files can also be used with other video players and software that support the format.

To use a .sbv file with a video file, both the video file and the .sbv file should be located in the same folder and have the same filename (except for the file extension). Many video players will automatically load the .sbv file when playing the video if the files are named in this way. If you need to create or edit a .sbv file, there are several subtitle editing tools available that support the SubViewer format. Some popular tools include Subtitle Workshop, Subtitle Edit, and Aegisub.

## SBV File Format â€“ More Information

The SBV file format is a simple text-based format used for storing subtitles for videos. SBV stands for "SubViewer" or "SubRip Video," depending on the source of the file. SBV files contain subtitles that are synchronized with the video content. Each subtitle consists of a timestamp indicating the start and end times of the subtitle, followed by the text of the subtitle. The timestamp is typically in the format of "hh:mm:ss,mmm" where "hh" represents hours, "mm" represents minutes, "ss" represents seconds, and "mmm" represents milliseconds. The text of the subtitle is usually in plain text format.

Here's an example of what an SBV file might look like:

```

SBV files can be created and edited with a variety of subtitle editing software, such as Subtitle Workshop, Aegisub, or Subtitle Edit. Once the subtitles are complete, the SBV file can be imported into a video editing program to create a subtitled video. Overall, the SBV file format is a straightforward and widely-used format for storing subtitles that is compatible with many video editing programs and players.
