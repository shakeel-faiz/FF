## What is an SESX file?

An SESX file is a session file created by Adobe Audition, a powerful audio production application. Unlike traditional audio files, `.sesx` files store a multitrack audio project in an XML format. This includes essential information about mixing, effects settings, and the organization of audio tracks within the session. Importantly, `.sesx` files do not contain the actual audio data. Instead, they save the pathnames to the audio files used in your project, allowing Audition to access the audio without embedding it in the session file.

The key features of the SESX file format include...

1.  **Session Data**: The `.sesx` file includes comprehensive details about all audio tracks within the project. This encompasses their order, duration, and any effects applied.
2.  **Reference Paths**: The file maintains paths to all audio files associated with the session, enabling Adobe Audition to locate and play these files seamlessly.
3.  **Mixing Information**: Mixing settings such as volume levels, panning adjustments, and effects configurations are stored within the `.sesx` file, preserving the project’s audio mix.
  
Adobe introduced the `.sesx` format in November 2007 with the release of version 3.0 of Audition. This new format replaced the previous `.SES` format, a binary file type that was the default audio project format in earlier versions. The shift to an XML-based structure made the `.sesx` files more accessible and easier to edit manually if necessary.

## Creating an SESX File in Adobe Audition

To create a new `.sesx` file in Adobe Audition, follow these simple steps:

1.  Open Adobe Audition.
2.  Navigate to **File → New → Multitrack Session...**.
3.  Customize the various settings for your session according to your project needs.

This process will create a new `.sesx` file that you can populate with audio tracks and effects.

## Importing Audio Formats

One of the strengths of the `.sesx` file format is its ability to work with various audio file types. You can import a wide range of audio formats into your projects, including:

-   [**.AIF**][1] (Audio Interchange File)
-   [**.FLAC**][2] (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
-   [**.AAC**][3] (Advanced Audio Codec)
-   [**.OGG**][4] (Ogg Vorbis)
-   [**.WAV**][5] (Waveform Audio File Format)
-   [**.MP3**][6] (MPEG Audio Layer III)

To import audio files into your Audition project, simply select **File → Import** and choose the desired audio files.

## Converting an SESX file

To convert a `.sesx` file, you typically need to open it in Adobe Audition. Once the session is loaded, you can export it to various audio formats. To do this, go to **File → Export** and choose **Multitrack Mixdown** or **Selected Clips**. Select your desired audio format (like WAV, MP3, or AAC) and specify the output settings, such as sample rate and bit depth. After configuring the settings, click **OK** to initiate the conversion. The new audio file will be saved in the specified location, while the original `.sesx` session remains unchanged.
