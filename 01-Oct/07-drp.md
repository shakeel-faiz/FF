## What is a DRP file?

A **DRP file** stands for **DaVinci Resolve Project file**, created specifically by **Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve software**. This file format is used to store all the necessary data to load a video editing project inside Resolve. However, it’s important to note that **DRP files don’t directly contain video, audio, or media files**. Instead, they contain **references** to the media files that are part of your project.

For example, when you are editing a video in DaVinci Resolve, the DRP file records all the changes, effects, timeline edits, and color grades, but it doesn’t embed the media files themselves. Think of the DRP file as a detailed set of instructions or a project blueprint.

## How DaVinci Resolve uses DRP files

DaVinci Resolve allows users to **combine, layer, trim**, and **add effects** to videos, audio, and images before rendering them into a final project. While working on a project, DaVinci Resolve saves various configuration files that represent the edits and settings, but not in one single location or file.

By default, your project data is saved within DaVinci Resolve’s installation directory. If you ever need to back up or share your project, you can **export** it as a **DRP file**. This gives you a single file that can be loaded back into DaVinci Resolve, but keep in mind, the actual media files (videos, images, audio) aren’t included in the DRP — only the references are.

## Backing Up and Exporting DRP Files

If you want to back up your project or move it to another system, exporting your project as a **DRP file** is the way to go. Here’s how:

1.  In DaVinci Resolve, navigate to the **File** menu.
2.  Select **Export Project...**.
3.  Save the DRP file to your desired location.

This exported DRP file contains the timeline, edits, color grading, effects, and overall project properties, but not the media. You’ll need to make sure you also transfer or keep copies of the media files used in your project. The DRP file will reference these media files from their original locations.

**Important Notes When Working With DRP Files**

It's essential to remember that **DRP files only contain a project’s data and settings**. If you transfer a DRP file to another computer, the project will only open successfully if the media files it references are also available. If the original file paths have changed or if the media files are not transferred along with the DRP file, the project may display missing media warnings.

## How to open DRP file

To open a **DRP file** in **DaVinci Resolve**, launch the software and go to the **Project Manager**. Click on **Import Project** and locate your DRP file on your system. Select it, and the project will load into DaVinci Resolve. Ensure that the media files (videos, audio, images) referenced in the project are accessible, as DRP files only store the project settings and timeline, not the actual media. If media files are missing, you may need to **relink** them manually by navigating to the new file paths. Make sure you’re using a compatible version of DaVinci Resolve.
