## What is an ASS file?

An ASS file, short for **Advanced SubStation Alpha**, is a subtitles file created with **Aegisub**, a cross-platform application for generating customized subtitles. These files are commonly used with movies, anime, and karaoke tracks, formatted using Advanced SubStation Alpha syntax, which offers robust styling and formatting features.

The key features of an ASS file include:

1.  **Customizable styles**: Users can modify the subtitle text's style, including font, color, size, and orientation.
2.  **Precise timing**: Supports exact synchronization of subtitles with video or audio.
3.  **Text effects**: Advanced features such as karaoke timing, animations, and fades.
4.  **Multiple languages**: Supports multiple subtitle streams within one file.
5.  **Speaker identification**: You can specify which character is speaking each line, and this information is saved within the ASS file.
6.  **Other settings**: Includes options like encoding, spacing, and text orientation.

ASS files are supported by many popular media players, such as VLC and MPC-HC, and they are often used when more advanced formatting is required compared to simpler subtitle formats.
