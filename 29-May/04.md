## What is a 3GPP file?

A 3GPP file is a multimedia file format used for storing audio and video content on mobile devices particularly in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) compliant devices. The 3GPP is a collaboration between various telecommunications standards organizations that develops and maintains standards for mobile communication systems.

The 3GPP file format is based on MPEG-4 Part 14 container format, commonly known as MP4. It supports storage of audio, video and other media types including text and images. The file extension for 3GPP files is typically ".3gp" or ".3g2" for 3GPP2 files.

These files are often used to store content recorded on mobile devices such as videos captured using a smartphone's camera. They can be played back on compatible devices or converted to other more widely supported video formats using various software tools or online converters.
