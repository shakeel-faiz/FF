## What is a RB file?

A ".rb" file extension is typically associated with Ruby programming language files. Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

A ".rb" file contains Ruby source code, which can be executed by a Ruby interpreter or a Ruby development environment. These files often contain definitions of classes, methods, variables, and other Ruby code constructs.

## How to run Ruby script in RB file?

To run a Ruby script saved in ".rb" file, you'll need Ruby interpreter installed on your system. Here's a basic example of Ruby script saved in file named "example.rb":

```
# example.rb

# Define a method to calculate the square of a number
def square(number)
  number * number
end

# Call the square method with an argument
result = square(5)

# Print the result
puts "The square of 5 is: #{result}"
```

To run this script, you can open your command line or terminal, navigate to directory where "example.rb" file is located and then use Ruby interpreter:

```
ruby example.rb
```

Executing above command will run script and output will be displayed in the console:

```
The square of 5 is: 25
```

This is a simple example but ".rb" files can contain more complex code, including classes, modules and control structures, allowing you to build full-fledged Ruby applications.

## What does RB file contain?

The specific contents of ".rb" file can vary depending on its purpose and the programmer who wrote it. However, in general, ".rb" file contains Ruby source code, which consists of series of instructions that the Ruby interpreter can understand and execute.

Here are some common elements that you might find in Ruby file:

- **Comments:** Ruby supports both single-line and multi-line comments. Comments are used to add explanatory notes or disable specific lines of code from execution. They are denoted by the # character.

```
# This is a single-line comment

=begin
This is a
multi-line comment
=end
```

- **Variable Declarations:** Ruby is a dynamically typed language, so variables don't need explicit type declarations. You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=).

- **Methods:** Ruby uses the `def` keyword to define methods, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

- **Classes and Objects:** Ruby is an object-oriented language, and classes are used to define object blueprints. Objects are instances of classes and can have attributes (instance variables) and behaviors (instance methods).

- **Control Structures:** Ruby provides various control structures like conditional statements (if, else, elsif, unless), loops (while, until, for, each), and more, to control the flow of execution in the program.

```
if age >= 18
  puts "You are an adult."
else
  puts "You are a minor."
end

# Output: You are an adult.
```

## What is the format of RB file?

The format of ".rb" file is plain text, typically encoded using UTF-8 or ASCII encoding. It follows a specific syntax and structure defined by the Ruby programming language.

## What is the MIME type of RB file?

- `application/x-ruby`
