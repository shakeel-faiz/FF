## What is a RB file?

A ".rb" file extension is typically associated with Ruby programming language files. Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

A ".rb" file contains Ruby source code, which can be executed by a Ruby interpreter or a Ruby development environment. These files often contain definitions of classes, methods, variables, and other Ruby code constructs.

## How to run Ruby script in RB file?

To run a Ruby script saved in ".rb" file, you'll need Ruby interpreter installed on your system. Here's a basic example of Ruby script saved in file named "example.rb":

```
# example.rb

# Define a method to calculate the square of a number
def square(number)
  number * number
end

# Call the square method with an argument
result = square(5)

# Print the result
puts "The square of 5 is: #{result}"
```

To run this script, you can open your command line or terminal, navigate to directory where "example.rb" file is located and then use Ruby interpreter:

```
ruby example.rb
```

Executing above command will run script and output will be displayed in the console:

```
The square of 5 is: 25
```

This is a simple example but ".rb" files can contain more complex code, including classes, modules and control structures, allowing you to build full-fledged Ruby applications.
