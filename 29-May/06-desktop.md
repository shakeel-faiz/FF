## What is a DESKTOP file?

A .desktop file is a configuration file used by Linux desktop environments to define application shortcuts and launchers. It provides metadata about an application such as its name, icon, command to execute and other properties. These files are typically used to create shortcuts in application menus, desktop launchers or panels in Linux-based systems.

## What does DESKTOP file contain?

A .desktop file follows specific format and contains several key fields:

- **[Desktop Entry]:** This is the main section header for the .desktop file.
- **Name:** Specifies the name of application.
- **Comment:** Provides brief description or comment about application.
- **Exec:** Defines command to execute when launching application.
- **Icon:** Specifies path to icon file associated with application.
- **Terminal:** Specifies whether application should be run in a terminal window.
- **Type:** Specifies type of entry such as "Application" or "Link."
- **Categories:** Specifies categories or groups under which the application should be displayed in the menu.
- **StartupNotify:** Specifies whether desktop environment should show a startup notification for application.
- **NoDisplay:** Specifies whether application should be hidden from menus.
- **Actions:** Defines additional actions that can be performed on application such as opening a specific file.

## Example DESKTOP file

Here is an example of a .desktop file for a fictitious text editor called "MyTextEditor":

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=MyTextEditor
Comment=A simple text editor
Exec=mytexteditor %F
Icon=/path/to/icon.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=TextEditor;Utility;
StartupNotify=true
NoDisplay=false
Actions=OpenNewWindow;OpenExistingFile;

[Desktop Action OpenNewWindow]
Name=Open New Window
Exec=mytexteditor

[Desktop Action OpenExistingFile]
Name=Open Existing File
Exec=mytexteditor %U
```

In this example, the .desktop file defines application "MyTextEditor" with its associated properties. It also includes two additional actions, "Open New Window" and "Open Existing File," which can be accessed from context menu of application launcher.

By placing a .desktop file in specific directories such as `/usr/share/applications` or `~/.local/share/applications`, the desktop environment will recognize it and display application accordingly in menus or allow it to be launched from desktop.
