## What is an AIF file?

The Audio Interchange File Format (AIF) is a widely used audio file format developed by Apple Inc. It is commonly used for storing high-quality, uncompressed audio data. AIF files are often used in professional audio applications and are supported by various software and hardware platforms.

AIF files can store audio data in variety of formats including PCM (Pulse Code Modulation), which represents the audio waveform directly, without any compression. This results in large file sizes but ensures maximum audio quality.

AIF files can also support metadata such as artist name, album title and track information making them suitable for organizing and managing audio files in music libraries.
