## What is a PRT file?

A ".prt" file is typically associated with "Creo Parametric," which is a 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software developed by PTC (formerly known as Parametric Technology Corporation). In Creo Parametric, a ".prt" file represents a 3D part or component of a larger assembly. These part files contain detailed information about the part's geometry, dimensions, features, and other properties.

## Key Points of PRT file

Here are some key points about ".prt" files in Creo Parametric:

1.  **File Format**: ".prt" stands for "part" in the context of Creo Parametric. These files are saved in a proprietary binary format used by the software.
    
2.  **Part Design**: A ".prt" file contains information about the design and geometry of a single part. Creo Parametric allows you to create 3D models of individual components or parts, and each part is typically saved as a separate ".prt" file.
    
3.  **Parametric Modeling**: One of the core features of Creo Parametric is parametric modeling. This means that changes made to a part file can propagate to any assemblies or drawings that use that part, helping to maintain consistency and reducing errors in the design process.
    
4.  **Assembly Files**: In addition to part files, Creo Parametric also uses ".asm" files for assemblies. These assembly files reference and bring together multiple part files, creating the overall product or structure.
    
5.  **Drawing Files**: Creo Parametric can also generate ".drw" files, which are used for creating 2D drawings and documentation based on the 3D part and assembly models.
    
6.  **File Interoperability**: While ".prt" files are specific to Creo Parametric, the software does support various import and export options to exchange data with other CAD systems and file formats, such as STEP, IGES, and more.
