## What is a PRT file?

A **.PRT** file is also associated with **Unigraphics or Siemens NX**, which is a widely used computer-aided design (CAD) software. In the context of Unigraphics or Siemens NX, a ".prt" file is an Unigraphics Part File. This file format is used to save and store 3D part or component data created within the Unigraphics or Siemens NX software. It can contain detailed information about the part's geometry, dimensions, features, and other properties.

## Key Points about PRT file

Here are some key points about Unigraphics Part Files:

1.  **3D Models**: .prt files primarily contain 3D model data. This data can represent mechanical parts, assemblies, or any other components created using Unigraphics.
    
2.  **Parametric Modeling**: Unigraphics uses parametric modeling, which means that the .prt files can include the history of operations performed on the part. This enables the modification of the part by altering its parameters or changing the history of operations.
    
3.  **Versatility**: .prt files are compatible with other Siemens NX files and are often used within assemblies (.asm files) to build complex structures or machines.
    
4.  **File Extension**: The file extension ".prt" is specific to Unigraphics or Siemens NX and is not a common file format for other CAD software.
    
5.  **Collaboration**: To collaborate with others who may not have access to Unigraphics, .prt files can be converted or exported to more widely supported formats, such as .STEP (.stp) or .IGES (.igs).
    

When working with Unigraphics Part Files, you'll typically use the Unigraphics or Siemens NX software itself to open, modify, and work with these files. If you have a .prt file and need to view or modify it, you will need access to Unigraphics or Siemens NX or compatible CAD software that can import this file format.
