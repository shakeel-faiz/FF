## What is a CDR file?

A **.CDR** file with **"Raw CD Audio Data"** typically refers to a file containing audio information extracted directly from an audio CD, such as music tracks. "Raw CD Audio Data" refers to the unprocessed digital audio data from a CD, which is often stored in a binary format. This raw data contains the audio samples exactly as they are on the CD, including both audio and subcode information.

These files are not typically meant to be played directly but are instead used for various purposes like CD mastering, audio editing, and CD burning. Software applications for audio editing and CD authoring often use this raw data to create audio CDs or convert it into other audio file formats like WAV or MP3.

If you need to work with .cdr files containing "Raw CD Audio Data," you would typically use specialized audio software to process or convert them, as they are not standard audio files that can be played in most media players.

## How to convert a CDR file?

To convert a .cdr file containing "Raw CD Audio Data" to a more common audio format like WAV or MP3, you'll need specialized software. If you're able to play your .cdr file in the VideoLAN VLC media player, you can also use VLC to convert it to different audio formats e.g.

- [.MP3](/audio/mp3/) - MP3 Audio
- [.FLAC](/audio/flac/) - Free Lossless Audio Codec
- [.WAV](/audio/wav/) - WAVE Audio
- [.OGG](/audio/ogg/) - Ogg Vorbis Audio
