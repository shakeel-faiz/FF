## What is a PRT file?

A **.PRT** file typically refers to a **CADKEY Part File**, which is a file format associated with **CADKEY**, a computer-aided design (CAD) software that was widely used in the past. CADKEY was developed by CADKEY Corporation, and it was primarily used for 2D and 3D design and drafting.

The ".prt" file extension is used to store individual part or component designs created using CADKEY. These part files can contain 2D sketches, 3D models, dimensions, and other design data specific to a particular component of a larger assembly.
