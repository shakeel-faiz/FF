## What is a PRT file?

The **.PRT** file format is associated with **Corel Presentations**, which is a software program used for creating presentations. Corel Presentations was a part of the Corel WordPerfect Office suite.

The ".prt" file extension indicates that it is a Corel Presentations template file. These templates are used as starting points for creating presentations and typically contain pre-designed slide layouts, backgrounds, fonts, and styles.

To work with a ".prt" file:

1.  **Opening**: You can open ".prt" template files with Corel Presentations or Corel WordPerfect Office, provided you have the software installed on your computer.
    
2.  **Creating Presentations**: When you open a ".prt" template, you can customize it by adding your own content, modifying the design, and creating a presentation based on the template.
    
3.  **Saving**: You can save your customized presentations in Corel Presentations as ".shw" files, which are the standard presentation files used by the software.
