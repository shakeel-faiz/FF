## What is a CDR file?

A **.CDR file** stands for **"Crash Data Retrieval Data File"**. These files are associated with event data recorders (EDRs) in vehicles. EDRs, often referred to as "black boxes" in cars, record various data related to a vehicle's performance and events that occur before and during a crash. This data can be crucial for accident reconstruction and analysis.

## CDR Data

The specific data contained in a .cdr file may include information such as:

1.  Vehicle speed
2.  Engine RPM
3.  Brake usage
4.  Airbag deployment
5.  Seatbelt usage
6.  Steering input
7.  Acceleration and deceleration rates
8.  Time and date of the event
9.  Vehicle identification information

Law enforcement, insurance companies, and accident investigators may use .cdr files to better understand the circumstances surrounding a car crash. Specialized software is typically needed to interpret and analyze the data within these files.
