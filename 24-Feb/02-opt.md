## What is an OPT file?

The OPT file extension is associated with Opterecenja files and represents a binary file format used by the software to save project data. Opterecenja is a software program developed by GIK-ING, a company based in Serbia. The software is primarily used for structural analysis and design of concrete and steel structures, including bridges, buildings, and other types of infrastructure. It offers various tools for modeling, analyzing, and designing structures, and provides detailed reports on the performance and safety of the structure.

Some of the features of Opterecenja include:
1. 2D and 3D modeling of structures: The software allows for the creation of complex structural models in both 2D and 3D, including beams, columns, slabs, walls, and other elements.
2. Structural analysis and design: Opterecenja provides advanced analytical tools for evaluating the performance of structures under various loads and conditions, including seismic loads, wind loads, and temperature changes. The software can also design structures based on various building codes and standards.
3. Material and cross-section libraries: The software includes a comprehensive library of materials and cross-sections for concrete and steel structures, which can be used in the modeling and analysis of structures.
4. Integrated reporting and documentation: Opterecenja can generate detailed reports on the performance and safety of the structure, including calculations, diagrams, and other relevant data. The software also allows for easy export of data and reports to other applications, such as Microsoft Excel and Word.

## How to open OPT file?

To open an OPT file created by Opterecenja, you would need to have Opterecenja software installed on your computer. Once the software is installed, you can open the OPT file by launching Opterecenja and selecting "Open" from the File menu. From there, you can browse to the location where the OPT file is saved and open it for editing or analysis within the software.
