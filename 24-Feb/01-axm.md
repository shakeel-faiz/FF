## What is an AXM file?

The .AXM file extension is used by Autodesk FormIt, which is a 3D sketching and modeling tool primarily used for architectural design. The AXM file is a binary file format that stores a 3D model created in Autodesk FormIt, including geometry, textures, materials, lighting, and other relevant data. The file format is specific to Autodesk FormIt and can be opened, edited, and saved in the software. The software also allows for exporting the file to other common 3D file formats, such as .OBJ or .FBX, for use in other CAD programs or game engines.
