## What is an IBA file?

IBA file extension is created by Lectra. This file format is also referred as Lectra Clothing Design Pieces file and falls under the category of CAD files. However, the primary file format used by Lectra Modaris is the MDL file format, which is a proprietary format developed by Lectra.
