## What is a PAN file?

A PAN file, in the context of Panorama, refers to a database file created by Panorama database software. Panorama is a database management system developed by ProVUE Development for macOS.

The PAN file extension is used to represent a Panorama database file, which stores structured data in a tabular format. These files can contain tables, records, fields, and data entries. Panorama provides tools for managing and manipulating data within these databases.

If you have a PAN file, you can use Panorama software to open and work with the database, perform queries, create reports, and perform various data operations.

## What does PAN file contain?

A PAN file is a database file created by Panorama database software. It contains structured data organized in a tabular format. Here is a breakdown of what a PAN file typically contains:

- **Tables:** A PAN file can have one or more tables, which represent different sets of related data. Each table consists of columns (fields) and rows (records).
- **Fields:** Fields define the structure and type of data within a table. Each field represents a specific attribute or characteristic of the data. Common field types include text, numeric, date, boolean, and more.
- **Records:** Records are the individual entries or rows within a table. Each record contains values for the various fields defined in the table. Records represent the actual data stored in the database.
- **Relationships:** PAN files can establish relationships between tables. Relationships define how different tables are related to each other, allowing for data consistency and integrity.
- **Indexes:** Indexes are data structures that help optimize database queries by providing quick access to specific data. They are created on one or more fields and speed up data retrieval operations.
- **Queries and Reports:** PAN files may also include saved queries and reports. Queries allow you to search, filter and extract specific data from the database. Reports help in presenting the data in a formatted and organized manner.

## What is the format of PAN file?

The PAN file format used by Panorama database software is a proprietary format developed by ProVUE Development. The specific technical details of the format are not publicly disclosed, as the format is specific to Panorama and its associated software.

However, PAN files are binary files that store structured data in a proprietary manner. They include information about tables, fields, records, indexes, and other database components, allowing Panorama software to read and manipulate the data efficiently.
