## What is a DDT file?

A DDT file, in the context of Football Manager, is a data file used by the game to store various information related to player attributes, team data, match statistics, and other game-related data. These files are specific to the Football Manager game and are not commonly used outside of the game's ecosystem.

DDT files are typically not meant to be opened or modified manually, as they are in a proprietary format specific to the game. Instead, they are read and processed by the Football Manager game engine to populate the game world with the necessary data.

## Football Manager Brief Overview

Football Manager is a popular series of football management simulation video games developed by Sports Interactive and published by Sega. The game allows players to take on the role of a football (soccer) manager and make decisions related to team management, tactics, player transfers, and more.

In Football Manager, you can choose to manage real-life football clubs from leagues around the world or create your own custom club. The game provides a detailed and realistic simulation of the football management experience, where you are responsible for various aspects of running a team.

## What does DDT file contain?

In Football Manager, a DDT file contains various data related to the game, including player attributes, team information, match statistics, and other game-related data. Here are some of the key types of data that can be found in DDT files:

- **Player Data:** This includes information about individual players, such as their attributes (e.g., speed, passing, shooting, etc.), positions, contracts, morale, and injury status.
- **Team Data:** DDT files store details about football clubs, such as their squad lists, managerial staff, financial information, stadium details, and youth development systems.
- **Competition Data:** Information about leagues, cups, and tournaments is also stored in DDT files. This includes fixtures, results, league tables, and rules specific to each competition.
- **Match Data:** DDT files contain data related to individual matches, including team line-ups, formations, tactics, substitutions, goals, assists, bookings, and other match statistics.
- **Scouting and Transfer Data:** The files may contain information about scouted players, transfer targets, and negotiation details, such as player values, contract demands, and transfer fees.
- **Staff Data:** DDT files store data about coaching staff, scouts, and other personnel associated with the football club.

## What is the format of DDT file?

The exact format of DDT files in Football Manager is proprietary and specific to the game. The format is not publicly documented, and the files are meant to be read and processed by the Football Manager game engine.

The DDT files are binary files, which means they contain data in a structured binary format that is not directly human-readable. The internal structure and organization of the data within the file are designed to be efficiently read and interpreted by the game engine for gameplay purposes.

Since the format is not publicly documented, modifying or manually accessing the contents of DDT files is not officially supported. To interact with Football Manager data or make modifications, it is recommended to explore the official modding tools or the dedicated modding community for Football Manager, where you can find resources and support for customizing the game experience within the guidelines provided by the game developers.
