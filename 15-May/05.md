## What is a KODU file?

A .kodu file is a file format used by Kodu Game Lab to save and store Kodu game projects. It contains all the necessary information about game, including terrain, objects, characters and programming logic.

## What does KODU file contain?

A .kodu file, used by Kodu Game Lab, contains all necessary data and information required to recreate and run a specific game project. While the exact internal structure and specifications of .kodu file format are proprietary, the file typically includes following types of data:

- **Terrain:** Information about layout, elevation, textures and features of game environment such as hills, water, trees and other elements.
- **Objects:** Details about objects placed in game world, including their positions, sizes, visual appearances and properties. Objects can represent various entities like characters, vehicles, items, or interactive elements.
- **Characters:** Characteristics, behaviors, and attributes of characters within game. This may include their appearance, movements, interactions and any programmed behaviors or rules governing their actions.
- **Programming Logic:** The visual programming code or logic that defines behavior and interactions of objects and characters in game. This can include rules, events, conditions and actions that determine how game elements behave.
- **Assets:** Any additional media assets used in game such as textures, sounds, music or custom models. These assets may be referenced within .kodu file to ensure they are correctly loaded when the game is opened.
- **Metadata:** General project information and settings such as game title, description, author and any specific configuration options or preferences.

The .kodu file serves as self-contained package that encapsulates all necessary elements to represent and run Kodu game project. It allows users to save and share their games while preserving all the relevant data and configurations.

## What is the format of KODU file?

The .kodu file format used by Kodu Game Lab is a binary file format specific to application. It is not a human-readable format like plain text or XML.

The exact specifications of .kodu file format are proprietary and not publicly documented. The file format is designed to store all necessary data and information about Kodu game project, including terrain layout, object placement, character behaviors, programming logic and other game assets.

As a binary format, the .kodu file is optimized for efficient storage and retrieval of game data within Kodu Game Lab software. It is not intended to be directly manipulated or edited outside of Kodu environment.

To work with .kodu files, you would typically use Kodu Game Lab software itself, which provides the tools and functionality to open, edit and run the game projects stored in this format.
