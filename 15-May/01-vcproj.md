## What is a VCPROJ file?

A VCProj file, also known as Visual C++ Project file, is an XML-based file that stores configuration and settings for project in Microsoft Visual Studio. VCProj files are primarily used in older versions of Visual Studio, up to Visual Studio 2010. Starting from Visual Studio 2012, the project files were changed to new format called VCXProj.

The VCProj file contains information about project's source code files, build settings, compiler options, linker settings and other project-specific configurations. It defines how project is built and what files are included in project.

## Example of VCPROJ file

Here is an example of what VCProj file might look like:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="Windows-1252"?>
<VisualStudioProject
	ProjectType="Visual C++"
	Version="9.00"
	Name="MyProject"
	ProjectGUID="{01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF}"
	Keyword="Win32Proj"
	>
	<Platforms>
		<Platform
			Name="Win32"
		/>
	</Platforms>
	<ToolFiles>
	</ToolFiles>
	<Configurations>
		<Configuration
			Name="Debug|Win32"
			ConfigurationType="1"
			InheritedPropertySheets="$(VCInstallDir)VCProjectDefaults\UpgradeFromVC71.vsprops"
		>
			<Tool
				Name="VCCLCompilerTool"
				AdditionalIncludeDirectories=".\include"
				PreprocessorDefinitions="_DEBUG;WIN32;_WINDOWS"
				RuntimeLibrary="3"
				UsePrecompiledHeader="0"
			/>
			<Tool
				Name="VCLinkerTool"
				AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib user32.lib"
				OutputFile="$(OutDir)\MyProject.exe"
				LinkIncremental="2"
				SuppressStartupBanner="true"
			/>
		</Configuration>
	</Configurations>
	<References>
	</References>
</VisualStudioProject>

```

## What does VCPROJ file contain?

A VCProj file contains various elements and settings related to Visual C++ project in Microsoft Visual Studio. Here are some of key information that can be found in VCProj file:

- **Project Information:** The VCProj file includes project-level information such as the project name, project type, version, and unique identifier (GUID) for the project.
- **Platforms and Configurations:** It specifies the platforms and configurations supported by the project. Platforms define the target platform, such as Win32, x64, or ARM, while configurations define different build configurations like Debug or Release.
- **Source Files:** The VCProj file lists the source code files that are part of the project, including C++ files, header files, resource files, and other related files. Each file is usually specified with its relative path to the project directory.
- **Build Settings:** It includes settings related to the build process, such as compiler options, linker options, preprocessor definitions, additional include directories, and additional dependencies. These settings define how the project is built and linked.
- **Precompiled Headers:** The VCProj file can specify whether the project uses precompiled headers, and if so, which file serves as the precompiled header.
- **Output Information:** It defines the output file or files generated by the build process, such as the executable file, dynamic-link library (DLL), or static library (LIB). The output file path and name can be configured in the VCProj file.
- **References:** The VCProj file may contain references to other projects or external libraries that the project depends on. These references help resolve dependencies during the build process.
- **Custom Build Steps:** If the project requires additional custom build steps, such as running scripts or executing external tools, the VCProj file can include instructions for these steps.
- **Debugging and Deployment:** The VCProj file may include settings related to debugging, deployment, and other project-specific configurations.

## What is the format of VCPROJ file?

The VCProj file format is based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which is a standard markup language for structured data representation. The XML format allows for the organization and storage of project-specific information and settings in a hierarchical structure.
