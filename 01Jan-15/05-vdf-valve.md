## What is a VDF file?

VDF file, also known as The Valve Data File, is a file format used by Valve's Source game engine to store various types of game-related metadata. VDF files store information related to Valve's Source game engine, including data for resources, installation scripts, configuration scripts, and visualization elements. VDF files are commonly encountered when installing games distributed through Valve's Steam game client, such as popular titles like Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike. 

VDF files utilize Valve's KeyValues format, which is a plain text format. The KeyValues format organizes data in a hierarchical structure using key-value pairs, somewhat similar to formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language). The key-value parameters in VDF files are organized in a tree hierarchy. This hierarchical structure allows for the representation of complex relationships and configurations within the game data. 

VDF files are human-readable since they are stored in plain text. This means you can open and view the contents of a VDF file using a simple text editor. The structure of the KeyValues format in VDF files shares similarities with JSON and YAML. Like these formats, it uses a straightforward syntax to represent data relationships and attributes. While VDF files are intended for use by the Valve Source game engine, they can be opened and inspected using a text editor, making it easier for users or developers to understand and modify certain game configurations.
