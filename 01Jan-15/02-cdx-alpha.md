## What is a CDX file?

CDX file is an index file used by Alpha Five, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for web application developers. In context of Alpha Five, a CDX file contains data that helps IDE locate specific records within table. When you define index fields in table within Alpha Five, a corresponding CDX file is created. This file is used to order lists in your data file based on specified index fields.

Alpha Five is an IDE used by web developers and CDX files are associated with this environment. CDX files store index data, which is crucial for quickly finding and retrieving specific records from table. CDX files are generated when you define index fields in table. These index fields determine the order of lists in data file. CDX file names are typically similar to table names and they can hold index names up to ten characters long with no spaces.

## About Alpha Five

Alpha Five was a comprehensive software platform and integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed to streamline process of building web applications. Launched with focus on rapid application development (RAD), Alpha Five offered developers a set of tools and features geared towards accelerating creation, prototyping and deployment of web-based applications. One of its defining characteristics was its emphasis on visual development, allowing developers to design applications through an intuitive graphical interface, thereby minimizing need for extensive manual coding.

A key strength of Alpha Five lay in its robust support for database integration. The platform made it significantly easier for developers to work with data-driven applications by providing seamless connectivity to various databases. This integration allowed developers to efficiently manage and manipulate data within IDE, contributing to platform's appeal for database-centric applications.

In notable development, Alpha Software Corporation, the entity behind Alpha Five, initiated rebranding effort in 2013. The platform was renamed "Alpha Anywhere," signifying continued commitment to advancing and adapting IDE in response to evolving landscape of web and mobile application development. The transition from Alpha Five to Alpha Anywhere marked a strategic shift in platform's evolution, reflecting its ongoing efforts to stay at forefront of industry trends and emerging technologies.
