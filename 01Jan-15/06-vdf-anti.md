## What is a VDF file?

A VDF file is a special file used by a program called AntiVir, which is an antivirus program for Windows. This file contains important information, specifically virus definitions. These definitions are like unique signatures that help the antivirus program recognize different viruses on your computer.

VDF file is like a book that the antivirus program reads to know what viruses look like. The book is regularly updated, usually when you update your antivirus software. This way, the program always has the latest information on how to identify new viruses.

These VDF files are stored in the folder where AntiVir is installed on your computer, and they have names like vbase000.vdf, vbase001.vdf, and so on. They are a crucial part of keeping your antivirus software up-to-date and capable of protecting your computer from the latest threats.
