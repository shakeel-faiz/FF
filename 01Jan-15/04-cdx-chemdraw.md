## What is a CDX file?

CDX file, also known as ChemDraw Exchange (CDX), is a file format associated with ChemDraw, a popular software for drawing chemical structures and reactions. The CDX file format is used to exchange chemical information between different instances of ChemDraw and other chemical drawing software.

CDX files are designed to store chemical structures, reactions, and related information in a format that can be easily shared between users and different software applications. CDX files are specific to ChemDraw, and they may not be directly compatible with other chemical drawing software that uses different file formats. However, ChemDraw allows for the import and export of various file formats to facilitate interoperability.

CDX files can contain information about chemical structures, including atom and bond details, as well as additional data such as reaction arrows, text annotations, and more. CDX files preserve the editable nature of chemical structures, allowing users to open and modify the structures using ChemDraw.
