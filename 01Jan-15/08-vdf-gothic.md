## What is a VDF file?

A VDF file is a type of file used by the Gothic video game series. It stands for "Video Data File." These files store important information for the game, such as the virtual worlds, characters, 3D models, textures (images that wrap around 3D objects), and sounds.

For example, in Gothic II, these VDF files are usually kept in the "/Gothic II/Data" folder on your computer.

People can technically edit these VDF files using programs like GoMan or a hex-editor (a tool for viewing and editing raw binary data), but it's generally not recommended. If you mess with these files the wrong way, you could make them unusable, causing issues with the game. So, unless you really know what you're doing, it's best to leave them alone.

## About Gothic Video Game Series

The Gothic video game series is a series of action role-playing games (RPGs) that started with the release of the first Gothic game in 2001. The series was developed by the German game developer Piranha Bytes.

The games are set in a medieval fantasy world and are known for their immersive storytelling, open-world exploration, and complex character interactions. Players typically control a character who is thrust into a challenging situation, often involving political intrigue, magical elements, and conflicts between different factions within the game world.

The series gained a reputation for its atmospheric world design, engaging narratives, and a sense of realism in the interactions with non-player characters (NPCs). Players make choices that affect the game's storyline and their character's development.
