## What is a HTT file?

Hypertext Template (HTT) is a file extension that was used by Microsoft Internet Explorer to create dynamic web templates. The HTT file contains a set of HTML and script code that could be used to generate web pages dynamically based on user input or other parameters.

HTT files were essentially text files with a combination of HTML and script code, usually written in VBScript. The HTT file format was designed to allow web developers to create templates for web pages that could be easily customized and modified without requiring extensive knowledge of HTML or scripting languages.

However, the HTT file format is now considered outdated and is no longer supported by modern web browsers. Instead, developers now use more advanced web development tools and technologies, such as server-side scripting languages like PHP, ASP.NET, or JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js, to create dynamic web pages.

## HTT File Format - More Information

HTT file typically includes HTML and script code that can be used as a template for creating dynamic web pages. Specifically, an HTT file might include:

1. HTML markup: An HTT file can include standard HTML markup, including tags for formatting text, inserting images, and creating hyperlinks.
2. Script code: The HTT file format supports VBScript, a scripting language that can be used to add dynamic functionality to the HTML elements in the template. The script code might include functions for handling user input, processing data, or interacting with other web technologies.
3. Variables: An HTT file might include variables that can be used to dynamically insert values into the HTML elements in the template. These variables can be set dynamically using script code or through user input.
4. Conditional logic: The HTT file format supports conditional logic statements that can be used to control the display of content based on user input or other parameters. This can be used to create dynamic web pages that adjust their content based on the context or user preferences.

Overall, an HTT file provides a way for developers to create reusable templates for dynamic web pages, allowing them to separate the presentation layer from the underlying data and logic. However, due to the limitations of the format and the rise of more advanced web development technologies, HTT files are no longer widely used.
