## What is an ANI file?

An ANI file is a type of file format used for storing animated cursor files in Microsoft Windows operating systems. ANI stands for "animated cursor" and these files typically have the file extension ".ani".

Animated cursors are small graphical images that are used to replace the standard cursor icon in Windows. ANI files allow the cursor to display a series of images in sequence, creating the illusion of movement. ANI files can be used to create simple animations, such as a blinking cursor, or more complex animations, such as a spinning globe or a bouncing ball.

ANI files are created using specialized software, such as Microsoft's Cursor Editor, and can be installed in Windows using the Mouse Properties dialog box. Users can select a new cursor from a list of installed cursors, including ANI files, and assign it to the various cursor actions, such as the default cursor, the text cursor, or the cursor used when hovering over a hyperlink.
