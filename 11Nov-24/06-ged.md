## What is a GED file?

A GEDCOM (Genealogical Data Communication) file, typically with a ".ged" extension, is a standard file format used for exchanging genealogical data between different genealogy software programs. GEDCOM files are plain text files that contain information about individuals, families, events, and other genealogical data. The purpose of GEDCOM is to provide a common format for the exchange of genealogical information.

## Key Points about GEDCOM Files

Here are some key points about GEDCOM files:

1.  **Plain Text Format:** GEDCOM files are plain text files, which means they can be opened and viewed with any text editor. This format facilitates easy sharing and compatibility between different genealogy software applications.
    
2.  **Structure:** GEDCOM files have a hierarchical structure. The data is organized into records, and each record has a specific tag that indicates the type of information it contains. For example, an individual's name might be represented by a "NAME" tag.
    
3.  **Individuals and Families:** GEDCOM files typically include information about individuals, such as names, dates of birth, and places of birth. They also include details about family relationships, marriages, and other events.
    
4.  **Software Interoperability:** Since GEDCOM is a standardized format, it allows users to move their genealogical data between different genealogy software programs. This is particularly useful for users who may switch to a different software application or share their research with others.
    
5.  **Version:** GEDCOM has gone through various versions, with each version introducing improvements and new features. The most commonly used version as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2022 was GEDCOM 5.5.
