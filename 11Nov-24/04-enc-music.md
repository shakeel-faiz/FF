## What is an ENC file?

An ENC file could potentially represent a musical composition crafted using Passport Music Software's Encore, a scorewriting application compatible with both Windows and macOS platforms. Within this file, you will discover a rich tapestry of musical notation, encompassing elements like notes, measures, time signatures, and key signatures. Additionally, the file encapsulates essential details such as the score's title and information about the composer who brought the musical piece to life.
