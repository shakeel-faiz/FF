## What is an ENC file?

An ENC file could also represent a musical composition crafted using Passport Music Software's Encore, a scorewriting application compatible with both Windows and macOS platforms. Within this file, you will discover a rich tapestry of musical notation, encompassing elements like notes, measures, time signatures, and key signatures. Additionally, the file encapsulates essential details such as the score's title and information about the composer who brought the musical piece to life.

## About Encore Software

Encore, initially developed by Don Williams for Passport Designs Inc. in 1984, was originally designed for the Apple Macintosh. In 1998, Lyrrus Inc., operating as GVOX, acquired the intellectual property of Passport, leading to the release of Encore 5 a decade after Encore 4.

A pioneering aspect of Encore lies in its distinction as one of the earliest scorewriter programs that empowered users to seamlessly add and edit elements within the musical score through the use of a mouse. This feature marked a significant advancement in the user interface of music notation software.
