## What is an SMC file?

The **.smc file extension** is commonly associated with **Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game ROMs**. The .smc file contains the ROM image of a Super Nintendo game and are essentially digital copies of the game cartridges that were used with the SNES console.

To play a Super Nintendo game using a .smc file, you would typically use an SNES emulator, which is a software that mimics the functionality of the original SNES console on your computer. Emulators allow you to load and play these ROM files, giving you the ability to enjoy classic SNES games on modern devices.

## SMC File Format - More Information

SMC files were initially generated and utilized by the Super Magicom, a tool used by SNES enthusiasts to produce and preserve backups of Super Nintendo video games. This functionality allowed gamers to maintain access to their games even if the original cartridge was lost or if the game file became corrupted. Nowadays, SMC files are commonly found on emulator-related websites, serving as a means for retro gamers to play Super Nintendo games on their personal computers.

These SMC files are closely connected to .SFC files, which represent Super Nintendo ROMs as well. SFC files are formatted in a way compatible with the Super Famicom, the original Japanese version of the Super Nintendo system.
