## What is an FS file?

The **".fs" file extension** is associated with **Visual F#**, a programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. F# is a functional-first programming language that is part of the Microsoft .NET ecosystem, and it is designed to be used for a variety of application types, including web, desktop, and cloud applications.

Visual F# Source Files (with the ".fs" extension) contain source code written in the F# programming language. These files can include functions, modules, types, and other F# language constructs. Visual Studio is a common development environment for F# programming, providing tools for editing, compiling, and debugging F# code.

Programmers use ".fs" files to write F# code, and these files are then compiled into executable files or libraries, typically with the ".dll" extension. The F# language is known for its concise syntax, immutability by default, and strong support for functional programming concepts.
