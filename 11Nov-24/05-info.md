## What is an INO file?

INO file is related to Arduino Sketch which is a program written for Arduino boards using the Arduino programming language. The Arduino programming language is based on Wiring, and it is similar to C/C++. Arduino Sketches are saved with a .ino file extension and are used to control Arduino circuit boards.

## INFO File Format - More Information

The Arduino platform, designed for electronic prototyping, empowers developers to craft and deploy programs, referred to as sketches, onto specialized circuit boards. These sketches range from fundamental tasks like illuminating an LED on a circuit board to intricate operations such as transmitting data across the internet. The creation of Arduino sketches takes place within the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and these sketches are stored with the .ino file extension.

In the era preceding Arduino 1.0, sketches were saved with a .PDE file extension by the Arduino IDE. Although the IDE still supports the opening of .PDE files, the recommended practice is to save all sketches, including those originally stored as .PDE files, with the .ino file extension. This shift reflects the evolution of the platform and ensures compatibility with current standards.
