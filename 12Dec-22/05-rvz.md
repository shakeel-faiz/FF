## What is an RVZ file?

An RVZ file is a special type of ROM file that works with a program called Dolphin emulator. Dolphin emulator lets people play Nintendo Wii and GameCube games on their regular computers. The RVZ file is like a compressed version of a Nintendo game, so you can play it on your computer. It is different from other game files because it is made to work exclusively on the Dolphin emulator, making games run smoothly.

If you want to use Dolphin emulator to play Nintendo games on your computer, you might come across RVZ files. These files were made by the Dolphin team in 2020 to make games run better on the emulator. If you already have games in a different format, like ISO files, Dolphin lets you change them to RVZ files. This can save space on your computer while still giving you a good gaming experience.
