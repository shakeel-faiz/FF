## What is a GCODE file?

A G-code file is a plain text file that contains instructions for controlling computerized machine tools and 3D printers. G-code, or "Geometric Code," is a language used to control the movements and actions of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. CNC machines include milling machines, lathes, routers and 3D printers.

G-code commands are written in a specific syntax, typically consisting of letters and numbers. Each command instructs the machine to perform a specific action, such as moving the tool to a particular position, changing the tool, or adjusting the speed.

G-code is often generated by CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software. CAM software takes a 3D model or a 2D design and generates the corresponding toolpaths and G-code instructions. The G-code file is then loaded into the CNC machine or 3D printer for execution.

G-code files typically have a ".nc" or ".gcode" file extension. For example, "program.nc" or "print.gcode."
