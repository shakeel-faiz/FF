1.  **Functionality**: The PSX BIOS is a set of low-level programs stored on a read-only memory (ROM) chip within PlayStation hardware. Its primary function is to initialize and control essential hardware components of console such as CPU, memory, graphics processing unit (GPU) and input/output devices.

These protections include region locking, which means that games from one region may not work on a console from a different region.
