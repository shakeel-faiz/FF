## What is a VRCA file?

A VRCA file is essentially an avatar file designed for use in VRChat, a virtual reality social platform. VRChat allows users to create and share their custom avatars for interaction in virtual worlds. The VRCA file serves as a container for all the essential elements of an avatar, including its 3D model, textures, shaders, and various data needed to represent a player's character within the VRChat environment.
