## What is Safetensors?

Safetensors is a new serialization format developed by a Hugging Face. It is like a special way to save and retrieve big and complicated data chunks called tensors, which are crucial in deep learning. Deep learning involves working with lots of data, and sometimes dealing with these big data pieces can be tricky. Safetensors helps make it easier and more efficient to handle these large and complex data parts when working with deep learning.

## What is Safetensors file?

Safetensors file stores algorithms to deal with tensors safely and used in machine learning model created by **Stable Diffusion** that **generates image from text description**. It is considered safe from any malicious code.

## What is tensor?

A tensor is a mathematical concept that is used in various fields, including physics and computer science. It is a way of representing data as a multi-dimensional array. In the context of **deep learning and artificial intelligence**, tensors are fundamental data structures used to organize and manipulate data. They can be vectors (1D arrays), matrices (2D arrays), or have more dimensions, and they play a crucial role in the operations performed by neural networks during the learning process. Think of a tensor as a container for numerical data arranged in a specific way to make computations and data processing more efficient.

## About Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a special kind of computer program, released in 2022, that uses a powerful technique called diffusion in deep learning. It is a part of the current wave of advancements in artificial intelligence.

Its main job is to create detailed pictures based on written descriptions, but it can also be used for other tasks like filling in missing parts of images, creating new parts outside the original image and transforming images based on written instructions. 

## How to open a SAFETENSORS file

If you want to use a SAFETENSOR file with Stable Diffusion, you need to put it in the folder where Stable Diffusion looks for models.
