## What is a PDO file?

Pepakura Designer is a program that allows users to create paper craft models from 3D models. Pepakura files typically have a .pdo extension. These files contain the instructions and layout information needed to print and assemble a paper model.

Pepakura Designer files are in a proprietary format specific to the Pepakura software. The file format is designed to store information about the 3D model, including its geometry, texture references, and assembly instructions.

Pepakura Designer works with 3D models in formats such as .obj, .3ds, .dxf, and others. These models are then unfolded into 2D patterns that can be printed and assembled into the final paper model.

The .pdo file includes instructions on how to cut, fold, and glue the printed paper pieces to recreate the 3D model. Each piece is labeled and numbered to guide the assembly process.
