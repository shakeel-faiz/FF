## What is a TSX file?

The ".tsx" file extension is commonly associated with TypeScript files that contain **React** code. **TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript** that adds static typing to the language, and **React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces**. When working with React and TypeScript together, developers often use the ".tsx" extension for their files to indicate that they contain both TypeScript and JSX (React's syntax extension for JavaScript).

## TSX File Example

TypeScript allows you to define types for your variables, function parameters and more. You'll often see TypeScript code in a ".tsx" file specifying the types of props, state and other variables used in React components.

```
// Example: TypeScript code in a React component
interface MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ name, age }) => {
  // Component logic here
  return <div>{name} is {age} years old.</div>;
};

```

## JSX (React Syntax Extension)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It looks similar to XML/HTML and is used to describe what the UI should look like.

```
// Example: JSX in a React component
const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ name, age }) => {
  return <div>{name} is {age} years old.</div>;
};
```

The ".tsx" file will typically contain the definition of a React component using functional components or class components.

```
// Example: React component definition in a ".tsx" file
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return <div>Hello, React!</div>;
};
```

You'll often see import statements at the beginning of the file, bringing in necessary dependencies and modules.

```
// Example: Import statements in a ".tsx" file
import React from 'react';
```
