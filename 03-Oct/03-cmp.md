## What is a CMP file?

The `.cmp` file format is related to **Windows Connection Manager Profile** and is used for storing connection profiles on Windows operating systems. These profiles are typically utilized by the Connection Manager to define specific settings required to establish a network connection, such as dial-up, VPN, or direct network connections.

A `.cmp` file typically contains:

-   **Connection settings** like the phone number (for dial-up), server addresses, or VPN parameters.
-   **Authentication details** like usernames, passwords, or certificates.
-   **Network protocols and settings**, such as TCP/IP settings.

**Where are `.cmp` files used?**

-   `.cmp` files are part of the **Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK)**, a tool that helps administrators create customized network connection profiles for users. These profiles can then be distributed to users, allowing them to easily connect to corporate networks or other managed services without manually configuring the connection details.

**How to work with a `.cmp` file:**

1.  **Opening/Editing**: These files can typically be viewed and edited using a text editor like Notepad because they are often stored in a plain-text format. However, caution is needed when editing as changes can affect connection behavior.
    
2.  **Distribution**: Once a `.cmp` file is created, it can be bundled into an installer package using CMAK, and distributed to users who need to set up network connections on their devices.

## What is Windows Connection Manager?

Windows Connection Manager is a tool that helps users manage and configure network connections on Windows devices. It allows for the creation of connection profiles, which define the settings required for different types of connections, such as VPNs, dial-up, and wireless networks. Administrators can use the Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK) to create customized connection profiles for easy distribution to users, simplifying the connection process while ensuring consistent settings across devices.

## How to open CMP file?

To open and view a **.cmp** (Windows Connection Manager Profile) file, you can follow these steps:

1. **Using a Text Editor (like Notepad or Notepad++):**

Most `.cmp` files are plain-text configuration files, so you can open and view them using a basic text editor. Here's how:

-   **Step 1**: Right-click on the `.cmp` file.
-   **Step 2**: Select **"Open with"** and choose **Notepad** or **Notepad++** (if installed).
-   **Step 3**: The file will open, and you'll be able to see the connection settings stored in the file, which might include information like server addresses, VPN settings, or dial-up numbers.

2. **Viewing/Managing with CMAK (Connection Manager Administration Kit):**

If you want to manage or modify the profile rather than just viewing it, you'll need to use the **Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK)**. This tool helps to create and manage connection profiles.

-   **Step 1**: Install CMAK (if it's not already installed). On some versions of Windows, it's available as an optional feature that can be added from **Windows Features**:
    -   Open **Settings** > **Apps** > **Optional Features** > **Add a Feature**, and search for **CMAK**.
-   **Step 2**: Once CMAK is installed, you can use it to open the `.cmp` file and make changes to the profile settings.
