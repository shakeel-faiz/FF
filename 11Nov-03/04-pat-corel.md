## What is a PAT file?

A ".PAT file is typically associated with CorelDRAW, a popular vector graphics editing software. In CorelDRAW, ".PAT" file is a "Pattern File" that contains information about patterns or textures that can be applied to objects in your design. Patterns can be used to fill objects with various repeating designs, such as stripes, dots or custom textures. These patterns are stored in ".PAT" files for easy reuse.

    -   Select the object or area with the pattern.
    -   Go to the "Object" menu and choose "Fill" to open the Fill tool.
    -   In the Fill tool, select "Pattern fill."
    -   Customize the pattern's properties, such as size, angle, and spacing.

    -   Go to the "File" menu and choose "Export" or "Save As."
    -   Choose the file format "CorelDRAW Pattern File (*.pat)."
    -   Specify a name for the file and choose a location to save it.
3.  Apply the Pattern:

.PAT files are specifically designed for vector images and page layout documents. They store patterns that can be seamlessly repeated within a vector-based image or a page layout, and they are often employed to apply textured backgrounds to designs. 

Corel CONNECT is a handy graphics content browsing tool that comes bundled with CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. It offers a package of various vector patterns that can be seamlessly integrated into your images or documents. These vector patterns are ready for use, making it convenient to enhance your designs with pre-made patterns, all within the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite environment.
