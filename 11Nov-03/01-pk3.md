## What is a PK3 file?

A PK3 file is a file format used in games that utilize the **Quake 3 Engine**, such as Quake 3 Arena, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and many other games. The "PK" in PK3 stands for "Packed" or "Package," and the "3" denotes that it's the third version of this file format. PK3 files are essentially archive files that can contain various types of game data, including maps, textures, models, sounds, scripts, and other resources.

PK3 files work like containers, holding various game-related stuff like maps, textures, sounds, and more. They are essentially ZIP files and you can use a regular Zip-decompression tool to open them up and access their contents.
