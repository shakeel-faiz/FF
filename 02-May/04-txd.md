## What is a TXD file?

A TXD file is a texture dictionary file used by Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series of video games. It contains game's textures which are applied to 3D objects in the game world to create a realistic environment.

The TXD file format is proprietary to GTA games and is not a standard file format used in other applications. It typically includes multiple image files in different formats such as BMP, PNG or TGA that are used to create the game's textures.

TXD files are usually created and edited using specialized software tools designed for modding and customization of GTA games. These tools allow users to import their own textures and modify existing ones to create custom skins, vehicles, buildings and other game elements.

## TXD File Format - More Information

The file structure of TXD file is specific to Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series of video games and is not a standard file format used in other applications. However, the general structure of TXD file is as follows:

1. Header
2. Texture data
3. Palette data
4. Mipmaps

## What does TXD file contain?

A TXD file contains texture data used by Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series of video games to render game world's 3D objects. Specifically, a TXD file contains the following:

- **Texture images:** The primary content of TXD file is one or more texture images in a variety of formats such as BMP, PNG or TGA. These images are used by game engine to apply textures to 3D models in game world such as buildings, vehicles and characters.
- **Texture metadata:** Each texture image in TXD file has associated metadata that describes the image's format, resolution, and compression type. This metadata is used by game engine to load and render the textures correctly.
- **Mipmaps:** In addition to the primary texture images, a TXD file may also contain pre-rendered smaller versions of the textures called mipmaps. These mipmaps are used by the game engine to improve performance by displaying lower-resolution versions of textures when the object being rendered is farther away.
- **Palette data:** For indexed color textures, a TXD file may also contain a palette that maps the color indices in the texture to specific RGB color values.
- **Other data:** Finally, a TXD file may contain other data such as configuration information for the game engine or information about the specific version of the game.
