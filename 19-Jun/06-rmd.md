## What is an RMD file?

An R Markdown (RMD) file is a text file with the extension ".rmd" that combine Markdown text with embedded R code chunks. It is a powerful tool for reproducible research and data analysis, as it allow you to write narrative text, include code, and generate dynamic reports or documents. It contains YAML metadata, Markdown-formatted plain text, and chunks of R code that, when rendered using RStudio, combine to form a sophisticated data analysis document.

R Markdown files are commonly used in the RStudio IDE, but you can also work with them in any text editor. When you render an RMD file, the code chunks are executed, and the output (such as tables, plots, or text) is inserted into the final document. This allows you to seamlessly integrate your data analysis and visualization with your written explanations.
