## What is an RMD file?

An R Markdown (RMD) file is a text file with extension ".rmd" that combine Markdown text with embedded R code chunks. It is powerful tool for reproducible research and data analysis, as it allow you to write narrative text, including code and generate dynamic reports or documents. It contains YAML metadata, Markdown-formatted plain text and chunks of R code that, when rendered using RStudio, combine to form a sophisticated data analysis document.

R Markdown files are commonly used in RStudio IDE, but you can also work with them in any text editor. When you render RMD file, code chunks are executed, and output (such as tables, plots or text) is inserted into final document. This allow you to seamlessly integrate your data analysis and visualization with your written explanations.
