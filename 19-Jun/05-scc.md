## What is a SCC file?

SCC files are video files created by ScreenFlow, a Mac OS X desktop screen recording application. It stores the captured video in a proprietary format and may also include audio captured from a computer microphone or from computer's sound card.

SCC files are used by ScreenFlow as temporary files to store unrendered video data before it is exported to final video format, during editing process in ScreenFlow, when you make changes to your video, apply effects or perform other edits, the software saves project progress in SCC files which contain raw video data and editing instructions.

Once you have completed the editing process and are ready to export your video, ScreenFlow renders the SCC files into desired output format, such as MP4 or MOV. The rendering process involves applying all the edits and effects to generate the final video file.

After rendering process is complete, temporary SCC files are typically deleted and final video file is saved with chosen output forma which can share, upload or use as needed.
