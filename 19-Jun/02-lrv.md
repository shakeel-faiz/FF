## What is an LRV file?

An LRV file, also known as Low-Resolution Video file, is a video file format that contains lower resolution version of video, commonly used in video editing workflows and video production to create low-resolution copies of high-resolution video files, are used to facilitate faster and smoother editing processes, especially when working with large video files or on systems with limited processing power.

LRV files are typically generated by camera systems, such as GoPro cameras, which create a lower-resolution version of original video during recording process, allowing users to quickly review footage, perform basic editing tasks and make selections without the need to handle larger, high-resolution files.

The LRV file format often uses H.264 or H.265 video compression codecs to reduce the file size while maintaining reasonable level of quality, but they are still capable of providing a decent preview of the content. Regardless of the camera's settings, LRV video is consistently recorded at a resolution of 240p with a frame rate of 29.97 frames per second.

## GoPro LRV File

GoPro cameras generate LRV (Low-Resolution Video) files as part of their recording process. LRV files are created alongside high-resolution video files (typically in MP4 format) and serve as lower-quality proxies for easier and faster editing.

The purpose of LRV files in GoPro cameras is to provide a lightweight version of the recorded footage that can be easily handled by editing software and systems with limited processing power. These files allow users to preview and edit their videos without the need to work directly with the larger high-resolution files, which can be resource-intensive.

GoPro LRV files typically have lower resolutions, reduced bitrates, and compressed codecs compared to the original high-resolution files. They serve as visual references during the editing process and enable smoother playback and scrubbing within editing software.

When editing with GoPro footage, most video editing software applications automatically recognize the LRV files associated with the high-resolution videos. This seamless integration allows users to edit using the proxy files and then relink the final project to the high-resolution files for rendering and exporting.

## THM File GoPro

THM files are small thumbnail files generated by GoPro cameras. These files are created alongside the corresponding video files and serve as visual previews or thumbnails for easier identification and organization of the recorded footage.

When you capture a video using a GoPro camera, it generates a THM file with the same base name as the video file but with a .THM extension. For example, if you have a video named "example.MP4," the corresponding thumbnail file would be "example.THM."

THM files are typically small in size and contain a low-resolution image representing a frame from the corresponding video. They can be viewed using any image viewer or media player that supports the JPEG image format.

The main purpose of THM files is to provide a quick visual reference for identifying the contents of the associated video files without the need to play or open them. They are commonly used for browsing and organizing footage on GoPro cameras or when transferring files to a computer.

## How to open LRV files?

To open and view LRV (Low-Resolution Video) files, you can follow these steps:

- **Rename to MP4:** To open and play an LRV file, you can easily do so by renaming the file extension to [.MP4](/video/mp4/) and using any application capable of playing .MPEG4 video files.

- **Video Editing Software:** The most common way to open and work with LRV files is by using video editing software. Most professional video editing software, such as _Adobe Premiere Pro_, _Final Cut Pro_, or _Davinci Resolve_, are capable of recognizing and importing LRV files. Simply import the LRV files into your project, and you'll be able to preview and edit the footage.

- **GoPro Software:** GoPro provides its own software called _GoPro Quik_, which is designed specifically for working with GoPro footage. You can download and install GoPro Quik from the official GoPro website. Once installed, open the software, import your LRV files, and you'll be able to view and edit them within the application.

- **Media Players:** While LRV files are not typically meant for direct playback, you can use certain media players capable of playing these files. _VLC_ media player is a popular choice that supports various video formats and codecs. You can download and install VLC, then open the LRV file directly through the media player.

- **File Conversion:** If you prefer to convert LRV files to a more widely supported video format, you can use video conversion software. Tools like _Handbrake_ or _Freemake Video Converter_ allow you to convert LRV files to formats like [MP4](/video/mp4/), which can be opened by a wide range of media players or video editing software.
