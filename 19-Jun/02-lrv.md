## What is an LRV file?

An LRV file, also known as Low-Resolution Video file, is a video file format that contains lower resolution version of video, commonly used in video editing workflows and video production to create low-resolution copies of high-resolution video files, are used to facilitate faster and smoother editing processes, especially when working with large video files or on systems with limited processing power.

LRV files are typically generated by camera systems, such as GoPro cameras, which create a lower-resolution version of original video during recording process, allowing users to quickly review footage, perform basic editing tasks and make selections without the need to handle larger, high-resolution files.

The LRV file format often uses H.264 or H.265 video compression codecs to reduce the file size while maintaining reasonable level of quality, but they are still capable of providing a decent preview of the content.
