## What is a SQX file?

SQX file is typically associated with SQX Archiver which is file compression and archiving utility. SQX Archiver is alternative to other popular compression formats like ZIP or RAR.

SQX Archiver uses its own proprietary compression algorithm to reduce file sizes and create compressed archives. It offers various compression levels and options to balance compression efficiency and processing speed. The resulting ".sqx" file contains compressed data and can be extracted using SQX Archiver or compatible software.

To work with ".sqx" file, you will need a software program that supports SQX format. SQX Archiver itself is one such program. You can use it to compress files and create ".sqx" archives or extract files from existing ".sqx" archives.

If you have ".sqx" file and want to extract its contents, you can use SQX Archiver or alternative utility that supports the SQX format. These programs typically provide options to browse the archive, select files for extraction and specify a destination folder for the extracted files.

## What does SQX file contain?

The contents of ".sqx" file created by SQX Archiver depend on what files were compressed and added to the archive. When you use the SQX Archiver to compress files and create an ".sqx" archive, it stores the compressed versions of those files within the archive.

An ".sqx" file can contain one or more files and directories, organized in a compressed form. The files could be of any type: documents, images, videos, executables, or any other file format. The purpose of compressing these files is to reduce their overall size and save disk space.

## What is the format of SQX file?

SQX Archiver uses a proprietary format for its ".sqx" files. The specific details of file format used by SQX Archiver may not be publicly available since it is a proprietary format. The file format includes information about compressed data, file metadata and any additional options or settings applied during the compression process.

While the exact specifications of the SQX file format are not widely documented, the SQX Archiver software itself provides the necessary functionality to create and extract files from ".sqx" archives. To work with an ".sqx" file, you would typically use the SQX Archiver or a compatible utility that understands the SQX format.
