## What is a SMPF file?

SMPF file is a compressed project file format utilized by Sprite Monkey, a lightweight application designed for efficient editing of sprite images. These files store both the sprite images themselves and the corresponding coordinate information specified within the user's project.

## Sprite Monkey Application

Sprite Monkey is a lightweight application specifically designed for editing sprite images. It provides users with a convenient and efficient way to work with sprite graphics. With Sprite Monkey, users can manipulate and modify sprite images, define coordinate information and perform various editing tasks related to sprite-based graphics. It is commonly used for creating sprites for video game characters or objects as well as buttons or symbols for webpages or programs.

## What are Sprite Images?

Sprite images are graphics or visual elements that represent specific object, character or element within digital environment such as video game or graphical user interface (GUI). In context of computer graphics and game development, sprites are typically 2D images or animations that can be moved, manipulated and rendered independently on screen or display.

A sprite image is usually a standalone graphic that represents single frame or pose of character, object or element. These individual frames or poses are often combined to create animations by rapidly displaying them in sequence. By changing the position, appearance or animation frames of sprites, developers can achieve the illusion of movement and interactivity within a digital environment.

Sprite images are commonly used in various applications including video games, mobile apps, web development and graphical user interfaces. They provide a flexible and efficient way to represent objects, characters, icons, buttons and other graphical elements, allowing for dynamic and visually appealing experiences for users.

Sprites are typically stored as separate image files such as PNG, JPEG or GIF and are often organized in sprite sheets, which are single images that contain multiple sprite frames arranged in a grid. These sprite sheets help optimize memory usage and facilitate efficient rendering of multiple sprites simultaneously.
