## What is a CBA file?

A Comic Book Archive (CBA) file, also known as Comic Book Archive or Comic Book Reader file, is a popular format used to store and distribute digital comic books. It typically contains collection of individual comic book pages or images bundled together in single file for easy organization and reading.

One of the common formats for creating Comic Book Archive files is the TAR (Tape Archive) format. TAR is a file archiving format used in Unix and Linux environments. It combines multiple files into single file often used for backup purposes.

## How to create CBA file?

To create Comic Book Archive file using TAR archiver tool, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Gather all the comic book pages or images you want to include in archive.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
3. Navigate to directory where comic book pages/images are located.
4. Use TAR command with appropriate options to create the archive. For example, the command might look like this:

```
tar -cf comicbook.cbt page1.jpg page2.jpg page3.jpg
```

In this example, the -c option tells TAR to create new archive and the -f option specifies output file name (comicbook.cbt in this case). After specifying the options, you provide the names of the files you want to include in the archive (page1.jpg, page2.jpg, page3.jpg).

5. After executing the command, the TAR tool will create the Comic Book Archive file (comicbook.cbt in this example) in the current directory.

Once you have Comic Book Archive file, you can use various comic book reader software or applications to open and read comic book on your computer or device. These applications typically provide features like page navigation, zooming and bookmarking to enhance the reading experience.

## What does CBA file contain?

A Comic Book Archive (CBA) file created using the TAR archiver tool contains a collection of individual comic book pages or images bundled together into a single file. The specific contents of the archive depend on the comic book being packaged.

Typically, a Comic Book Archive file includes the following:

- **Comic book pages:** The main content of the archive is the comic book pages themselves. These pages are usually saved as individual image files, such as JPEG or PNG, representing each page of the comic book. The pages are arranged in a specific order to maintain the narrative flow of the comic.
- **Metadata:** Some Comic Book Archive formats may include metadata about the comic book, such as the title, author, publisher, publication date, and description. This information helps identify and categorize the comic book.
- **Additional files:** In addition to the comic book pages and metadata, the archive may contain other supplementary files related to the comic book. These files could include cover art, promotional images, bonus content, or text files providing additional information or commentary.

## What is the format of CBA file?

The Comic Book Archive (CBA) file format created using TAR archiver tool is typically in TAR format. TAR, short for Tape Archive, is a file archiving format commonly used in Unix and Linux systems. It is not specific to comic books but is a general-purpose archiving format.

The TAR format is straightforward way to bundle multiple files into single archive file. It does not provide compression by itself, so the resulting TAR file may be large in size compared to other compressed formats like ZIP or RAR. However, TAR files can be compressed using additional tools or combined with compression algorithms like gzip or bzip2 to reduce file size.

The TAR format preserves file structure, file permissions and timestamps of included files. It stores files sequentially within archive, allowing easy extraction of individual files or entire archive.
