## What is a MSWMM file?

MSWMM (Movie Maker Project) is a file format used by the Windows Movie Maker application, which is a video editing software developed by Microsoft for Windows operating systems. MSWMM files are used to save movie projects created using Windows Movie Maker. Just like WLMP files, MSWMM files are not video files, but rather project files that contain information about the arrangement of video clips, photos, and audio tracks in a movie project, as well as the applied effects and transitions.

To open an MSWMM file, you need to use the Windows Movie Maker application. Once the project is loaded into the application, you can edit it, add or remove elements, and export it as a video file format such as WMV or MP4 to be played on media players.
