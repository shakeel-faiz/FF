## What is a WLMP file?

WLMP (Windows Live Movie Maker Project) is a proprietary file format used by the Windows Live Movie Maker application to save movie projects. It contains information about the arrangement of video clips, photos, and audio tracks in a project, as well as the effects and transitions applied to them. WLMP files cannot be played on media players, they need to be exported as a video file format such as WMV or MP4 to be played.

The actual content of a WLMP file is stored in an XML (Extensible Markup Language) format and includes information about the project such as the size and length of the video, the location and duration of each media clip, the applied transitions and effects, and other project-related details. The XML code in the WLMP file describes the sequence of events in the movie project and serves as a blueprint for the final video production. However, the WLMP file itself does not contain the actual media files such as video clips and audio tracks, but rather the references to their location on the computer's hard drive.

## Export WLMP to WMV or MP4

To upload a WLMP file to YouTube, you need to first export it as a video file format that is compatible with YouTube, such as WMV or MP4. To do this, you can use the Windows Live Movie Maker application to save the movie project as a video file.

Here's the general steps to export a WLMP file to WMV or MP4:

1. Open Windows Live Movie Maker and load the WLMP project.
2. Go to the "Home" tab and click on "Save movie."
3. Select "For computer" and then choose either "WMV" or "MP4" as the file format.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to save the movie project as a video file.
