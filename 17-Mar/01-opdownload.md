## What is an OPDOWNLOAD file?

An Opera Partially Downloaded File is a file that has been partially downloaded using the Opera web browser. Opera saves files as they download, and if a download is interrupted or paused, the partially downloaded file is saved with an "opdownload" extension. When a download is complete, the ".opdownload" extension is removed, and the file becomes usable. However, if the download is interrupted or incomplete, the ".opdownload" extension remains, and the file is unusable until the download is resumed or completed. To resume a partially downloaded file in Opera, simply click on the "Resume" button that appears next to the file in the download manager. If the download cannot be resumed, you may need to restart the download from scratch.

## OPDOWNLOAD File Format â€“ More Information

The OPDOWNLOAD file format is not a specific file format in and of itself. Rather, it is a temporary file extension used by the Opera web browser when a file is being downloaded.

When you download a file in Opera, the browser starts by creating a temporary OPDOWNLOAD file with the same name as the final file. As the file is downloaded, the data is saved to this temporary file. Once the download is complete, Opera removes the OPDOWNLOAD extension from the file name and saves the file in its final format.

So, an OPDOWNLOAD file does not have a specific inner file format. It simply contains the data that has been downloaded so far for the file you are downloading. Once the download is complete, the OPDOWNLOAD file is renamed to its final format, such as a ZIP, PDF, or JPG file.

OPDOWNLOAD files are much like .CRDOWNLOAD files used by Google Chrome and .DOWNLOAD files used by Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari. They share similarities in that they are temporary file extensions used during the downloading process.
