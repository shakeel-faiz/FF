## What is a VCS file?

A VCS file, or vCalendar file, serves as a container for storing information related to calendar events. It is structured in a plain text format, making it readable and editable by both humans and computers. The key components included in a VCS file are the event's title, date and time details, location, and any other pertinent information associated with the scheduled activity.

The vCalendar format, represented by the VCS file extension, was widely utilized for sharing calendar data in the past. However, with advancements in technology and the need for more standardized and interoperable formats, the vCalendar format has largely been superseded by the more prevalent .ICS (iCalendar) format. ICS files are also plain text and follow a similar structure to VCS files, but they offer additional features and improvements, making them more versatile and widely supported across various calendar applications and platforms.
