## What is a GB file?

GB file format also known as Game Boy ROM file is a digital copy of the game data from a Nintendo Game Boy cartridge. These files typically have a .gb file extension. The Game Boy was a popular handheld gaming console released by Nintendo, and it had a wide range of games that were distributed on physical cartridges. Users can create digital backups of these cartridges, resulting in ROM files that can be played using emulators on various platforms.

## GB File Format - More Information

Emulators are software programs that mimic the behavior of specific gaming consoles, allowing users to play games on different devices, such as computers or mobile phones. To play a Game Boy ROM file, you would need a Game Boy emulator compatible with your platform, and then you can load the ROM file into the emulator to play the game.

To make this work, gamers need to take the game data (the stuff that makes the game run) from the physical cartridges of their games. They use special tools and software to copy this data from the cartridges and save it on their computer in a special format called GB. Once the game data is on the computer in the GB format, they can use an emulator like VisualBoyAdvance, KiGB, or BGB to play these games. Some gamers share these GB files with others so that they can also download and play the games on their own computers using emulators.
