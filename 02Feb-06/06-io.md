## What is an IO file?

IO file is associated with BrickLink Studio, a software tool used for designing virtual LEGO models. When you save a LEGO model in BrickLink Studio, it is saved with the ".io" file extension.

BrickLink Studio uses the IO file extension format to store all the information about the LEGO model you've created, including the placement and configuration of bricks, colors, and other elements. This file format allows you to save and share your designs with others who use BrickLink Studio or compatible software.

## About BrickLink Studio

BrickLink Studio is a software tool designed for LEGO enthusiasts who love building and designing their own creations digitally. It provides users with a virtual environment where they can assemble LEGO models using a vast array of digital LEGO elements, including bricks, plates, minifigures, and more.

Key features of BrickLink Studio include:

1.  **Building Tools**: BrickLink Studio offers a variety of tools and features to help users construct their LEGO models with precision and creativity. These tools allow for easy manipulation, rotation, and placement of LEGO elements, enabling users to bring their ideas to life in the digital realm.
    
2.  **Rendering**: The software includes rendering capabilities, allowing users to visualize their LEGO creations in high-quality 3D graphics. This feature enables users to see how their models will look from different angles and perspectives, enhancing the design process.
    
3.  **Instruction Generation**: BrickLink Studio enables users to generate step-by-step building instructions for their LEGO models. This functionality is invaluable for sharing designs with others or for personal reference when building the physical model later.
    
4.  **Part Library**: The software provides access to an extensive library of digital LEGO parts, including pieces from various LEGO themes and collections. This vast selection of elements gives users the freedom to create virtually any LEGO model they can imagine.

## Stud IO Files

"Stud.io" is another popular software used by LEGO enthusiasts for digital LEGO design, similar to BrickLink Studio. Like BrickLink Studio's ".io" file format, Stud.io also uses its own file format to save LEGO models. However, Stud.io saves files with a ".io" extension as well, which can sometimes cause confusion.

Stud.io files, often referred to as ".io" files, contain all the information necessary to represent a LEGO model digitally. This includes details about the placement, orientation, and color of each LEGO element within the model.

Stud.io offers many of the same features as BrickLink Studio, including a wide selection of digital LEGO parts, tools for building and editing models, rendering capabilities for creating high-quality images, and the ability to generate step-by-step building instructions.

When you save a LEGO model in Stud.io, it creates an ".io" file that stores all the information about the model. These files can be reopened in Stud.io for further editing or sharing with others. Additionally, Stud.io allows users to export models to various file formats for use in other software or for sharing with the broader LEGO community.
