## What is an XDELTA file?

XDELTA file is generated by the xdelta tool. It is a file format designed to hold the binary difference between two other files. The xdelta tool is a command line utility for delta encoding. Delta encoding involves calculating the differences between two files and encoding those differences in a compact format. XDELTA files store binary data, which represents the changes or differences between the original file and the updated file. The binary data in the XDELTA file represents the changes needed to transform one file (the original) into another file (the updated or patched version).

XDELTA files are frequently used in the gaming community to distribute modifications (mods) for video games. These mods can include anything from cosmetic changes to significant alterations in gameplay mechanics. XDELTA files allow users to apply these modifications to their game installations by patching the original game files with the changes specified in the XDELTA file.

## xdelta

`xdelta` is a command-line utility used for delta encoding and decoding. It is primarily employed to create and apply binary patches, often called "delta patches" or "xdelta patches", between two files. These patches represent the differences between the original file and the modified or updated version, allowing for efficient distribution of updates, particularly in scenarios where bandwidth or storage space is limited.

Here is a brief overview of the main functionalities of `xdelta`:

1.  **Creating patches**: `xdelta` can generate a patch file that contains the differences between two files. This patch file, often referred to as an "xdelta patch", is relatively small compared to the original and updated files, as it only contains the changes between them.
    
2.  **Applying patches**: Once a patch file is created, `xdelta` can apply it to the original file to produce the updated file. This process involves taking the original file and the patch file as input and applying the changes specified in the patch file to generate the updated file.
    
3.  **Applying reverse patches**: `xdelta` can also apply reverse patches, which revert changes made to a file. This is useful for rolling back updates or modifications.
    

`xdelta` is commonly used in various scenarios, such as distributing software updates, patching video games, and updating system files in embedded devices or network appliances. It provides a flexible and efficient way to manage file updates while minimizing bandwidth usage and storage requirements.

## xdeltaui

xdeltaui is a graphical user interface (GUI) application for managing and applying XDELTA patches. xdelta gui	provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with XDELTA files and apply them to the corresponding original files, effectively patching or updating them.

Unlike the command-line version of xdelta, which operates through text-based commands, xdeltaui offers a more intuitive way to handle XDELTA files, especially for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces or prefer graphical tools.

With xdeltaui, users can typically perform tasks such as selecting the original file, selecting the XDELTA patch file, and applying the patch to generate the updated file. This can be particularly useful for installing mods or updates for video games or other software applications.

## xdelta Download

On Linux systems, you may use package managers like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf` to install `xdelta`. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install xdelta3
```

## How to use xdelta

To use `xdelta`, you typically need to follow these general steps:

1.  **Download and Install**: First, ensure that you have `xdelta` installed on your system. You can download it from its official website, package managers, or other trusted sources.
    
2.  **Prepare Files**: Prepare the original file (often called the source or base file) and the updated file (target file) that you want to create a patch for or apply a patch to.
    
3.  **Creating a Patch**:
    
    -   Open your command-line interface (terminal or command prompt).
    -   Use the `xdelta` command with appropriate options to create a patch. The basic syntax is:
               
        ```
        xdelta delta <original_file> <updated_file> <patch_output_file>
        ``` 
        
        Replace `<original_file>` with the path to the original file, `<updated_file>` with the path to the updated file, and `<patch_output_file>` with the desired name for the patch file.
    -   Example:
               
        ```
        xdelta delta original_file updated_file patch.xdelta
        ``` 
        
4.  **Applying a Patch**:
    
    -   Ensure you have the original file and the patch file available.
    -   Open your command-line interface.
    -   Use the `xdelta` command with appropriate options to apply the patch. The basic syntax is:
        
      
        ```
        xdelta patch <original_file> <patch_file> <output_file>
        ``` 
        
        Replace `<original_file>` with the path to the original file, `<patch_file>` with the path to the patch file, and `<output_file>` with the desired name for the output file.
    -   Example:
                
        ```
        xdelta patch original_file patch.xdelta updated_file
        ``` 
        
5.  **Viewing Help**: If you need assistance with specific options or commands, you can use the `xdelta` command with the `--help` option to display usage information and available options.
    
## How to open an XDELTA file

XDELTA files are not intended for direct opening. If you wish to apply an XDELTA patch to a game or another file, you have the option of using either xdelta, which is compatible across multiple platforms, or xdelta UI, specifically tailored for Windows users.
