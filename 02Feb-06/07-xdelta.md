## What is an XDELTA file?

XDELTA file is generated by the xdelta tool. It is a file format designed to hold the binary difference between two other files. The xdelta tool is a command line utility for delta encoding. Delta encoding involves calculating the differences between two files and encoding those differences in a compact format. XDELTA files store binary data, which represents the changes or differences between the original file and the updated file. The binary data in the XDELTA file represents the changes needed to transform one file (the original) into another file (the updated or patched version).

XDELTA files are frequently used in the gaming community to distribute modifications (mods) for video games. These mods can include anything from cosmetic changes to significant alterations in gameplay mechanics. XDELTA files allow users to apply these modifications to their game installations by patching the original game files with the changes specified in the XDELTA file.
