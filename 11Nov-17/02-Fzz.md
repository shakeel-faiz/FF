## What is an FZZ file?

The ".fzz" file extension is associated with **Fritzing**, an open-source hardware initiative that makes electronics accessible as a creative material for anyone. Fritzing allows users to design and document their electronic projects. The ".fzz" file is a Fritzing Shareable Project File, which means it contains the information about the components, connections and layout of a particular electronics project created using Fritzing.

 ##  FZZ file - Brief Overview

 Here is a brief overview of what you can expect in a ".fzz" file:

1.  **Schematic Information:** The file will store information about the components used in your circuit, their connections and their properties.
    
2.  **Breadboard Layout:** Fritzing allows you to create a physical representation of your circuit on a virtual breadboard. The ".fzz" file will contain data about how the components are arranged on the breadboard.
    
3.  **PCB Layout (if applicable):** If you have created a custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layout for your project in Fritzing, the ".fzz" file will store information about the placement and connections of components on the PCB.
    
4.  **Metadata:** The file may also include metadata such as the project name, author information, and other details entered by the user.
