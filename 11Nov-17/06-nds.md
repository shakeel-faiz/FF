## What is an NDS file?

The .NDS file extension is commonly associated with the **"Nero DiscSpan Compilation File"**. Nero DiscSpan is a feature in **Nero Burning ROM**, a popular optical disc authoring program. This feature allows users to span large amounts of data across multiple discs.

When you create a DiscSpan compilation in Nero Burning ROM, it divides the data into smaller segments that fit on individual discs. The .nds file is created as a descriptor file that contains information about the layout and spanned data across the discs.

If you have a .nds file and corresponding disc segments, you can use Nero Burning ROM or Nero DiscSpan to restore the original data. Nero DiscSpan will prompt you to insert each disc in sequence to reconstruct complete compilation.
