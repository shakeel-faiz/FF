## What is an MP5 file?

A file with ".mp5" extension typically refers to a video file specifically designed for playback on **Chinese MP5 portable media players**. These MP5 files are essentially similar to standard .MP4 files, as they use the MPEG-4 or MPEG-H codecs for encoding. The primary distinction lies in the optimization of MP5 files, ensuring they are well-suited for playback on Chinese MP5 media players. Essentially, it is a specialized video format tailored for compatibility and optimal performance on these particular portable media devices.

## Difference between MP4 and MP5

To distinguish themselves from other media players, numerous Chinese portable media players market themselves as "MP5 players." In reality, there isn't a distinct MP5 file format. The so-called MP5 files associated with these media players are essentially MP4 files that have been renamed. Typically encoded using the H.264/AVC or MPEG-4 codec, these files can often be played on any MP4 media player by simply changing their file extension to .mp4. Essentially, the term "MP5" in this context does not refer to a unique file format but rather serves as a marketing label for compatibility with MP4-encoded content on these devices.

## How to open an MP5 file

MP5 files can directly be played on Chinese portable media players like Baidu Player. But easiest way is to **change their extension to .mp4** and play on any MP4 media player e.g. VideoLAN VLC media player.

## How to convert MP5 to MP4

MP5 is already an MP4 file, just change the extension of MP5 to MP4 and play it in your MP4 media player.
