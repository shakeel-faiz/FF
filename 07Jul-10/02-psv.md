## What is a PSV file?

A "Pluralsight Video File" (PSV) is a proprietary video file format used by the Pluralsight online learning platform. Pluralsight provides video-based courses and tutorials on various topics related to software development, IT, and creative skills.

PSV files are specifically encoded and encrypted for use within the Pluralsight platform and are not intended for direct playback outside of the official Pluralsight application or website.

To access and watch Pluralsight courses, you generally need a valid Pluralsight subscription or access provided by your organization. You can use the official Pluralsight application or access the content through their website using a web browser.
