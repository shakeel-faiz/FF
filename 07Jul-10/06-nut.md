## What is a NUT file?

The NUT (NUT Open Container Format) is a video container format similar to AVI, ASF, and MKV. It is designed to support various audio and video codecs, as well as subtitle information. The NUT format aims to provide a flexible container for multimedia content, allowing for the inclusion of different audio and video streams within a single file. It supports features such as multiple audio tracks, multiple video tracks, and subtitles.

While the NUT format is not as widely used or supported as some other popular video container formats, such as MP4 or MKV, it can still be used for storing multimedia content. However, due to its relative obscurity and limited support, you may encounter compatibility issues when trying to play or work with NUT files in various media players or video editing software.

If you have a video file in the NUT format and you need to work with it, you may need to convert it to a more widely supported format like MP4 or MKV. There are several video conversion tools available that can assist you in this process.
