## What is a MUI file?

MUI refers to Myriad User Instrument files. Myriad User Instrument (MUI) is a proprietary file format used by the Harmony Assistant software, which is a music notation and composition software developed by Myriad Software. MUI files contain digital instrument sounds and other music data used by the Harmony Assistant program.

MUI files are generally not compatible with other music software, as they are designed to work specifically with the Harmony Assistant program. To open an MUI file, you need to have the Harmony Assistant software installed on your computer. Once you have Harmony Assistant installed, you can import the MUI file into the program and use the included instrument sounds and other data to compose and arrange music.

## Relation with Harmony Assistant

The MUI file format is related to the Harmony Assistant software, which is a music composition and notation program developed by Myriad Software. The MUI file format is used by Harmony Assistant to store custom instrument sounds and other music data created by users.

Harmony Assistant allows users to create their own digital instruments using the built-in sound editor or by importing sounds from other sources. These custom instruments can be saved as MUI files and used in future compositions.

MUI files can also be shared with other users of Harmony Assistant, allowing musicians and composers to exchange their custom instruments and musical ideas. However, MUI files cannot be used with other music software, as they are specific to the Harmony Assistant program.

## How to open MUI file?

To open the MUI file, you will need to have the Harmony Assistant software installed on your computer. Here are the general steps to open an MUI file using Harmony Assistant:

1. Launch the Harmony Assistant software.
2. Click on "File" in the menu bar and select "Open" from the drop-down menu.
3. Browse to the location of the MUI file that you want to open and select it.
4. Click on "Open" to import the MUI file into Harmony Assistant.
5. Once the MUI file is imported, you should be able to access the included instrument sounds and other data in the Harmony Assistant software.
