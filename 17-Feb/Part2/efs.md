## What is an EFS file?

The EFS Ensoniq SQ-80 file is a type of file format used by the Ensoniq SQ-80 synthesizer, a popular analog/digital hybrid synthesizer from the 1980s. The Ensoniq SQ-80 was known for its powerful and unique sound, which was due in part to its ability to combine both digital and analog sound synthesis techniques. The SQ-80 used a type of synthesis called wavetable synthesis, which involved using short digital waveforms to create complex sounds.

EFS (Ensoniq File System) is the file system used by Ensoniq synthesizers to store and manage sounds and other data. The EFS Ensoniq SQ-80 file format is used to save and transfer sound patches and other data between different Ensoniq SQ-80 synthesizers, or between an SQ-80 and a computer or other device.

EFS Ensoniq SQ-80 files typically have a .EFE file extension and can contain a variety of data, including individual sound patches, multi-patches (which combine multiple sounds), and system data such as MIDI setups and other configuration settings. These files can be transferred to and from the SQ-80 using a variety of tools, such as Ensoniq's own SQ-80 Editor software or third-party tools that support the EFS file format.

## How to open EFS file?

To open an EFS file, you will need a software program that supports the Ensoniq File System (EFS) format, which is used by Ensoniq synthesizers like the SQ-80. Here are a few options:

1. Ensoniq SQ-80 Editor - This is the official software from Ensoniq that was used to manage sounds and data on the SQ-80. You can download it from various websites online.
2. Awave Studio - This is a commercial audio conversion and editing software that supports a wide range of audio file formats, including EFS files.
3. VSampler - This is another commercial audio sampler software that can open and edit EFS files.

Once you have installed the software, you can open the EFS file by selecting the "Open" or "Import" option in the software and browsing to the location of the EFS file on your computer. From there, you should be able to see the list of sounds and other data contained within the EFS file, and you can edit or modify them as needed.
