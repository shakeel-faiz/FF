## 🗓️ DAILY STRUCTURE (Follow in Order)

### 1️⃣ Algorithm & CS Thinking (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Learn *how to think*, not how to code

**Primary Playlists (YouTube – FREE)**

* **Abdul Bari – Algorithms (Theory)**

  * Search on YouTube: `Abdul Bari Algorithms playlist`
  * Watch ONLY:

    * Big O Notation
    * Time & Space Complexity
    * Why one algorithm is better than another

* **NeetCode – Big O & Complexity**

  * Search: `NeetCode Big O playlist`
  * Focus on explanation videos, skip coding

**Daily Question to Ask Yourself**

* What is the trade-off here?

---

### 2️⃣ LLM & AI Reality Check (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand why small models fail and large models are needed

**Primary Playlists (YouTube – FREE)**

* **DeepLearning.AI – Generative AI**

  * Search: `DeepLearningAI Generative AI playlist`
  * Watch topics:

    * How LLMs work
    * Hallucinations
    * Context window limits

* **Andrej Karpathy – Neural Networks & LLMs**

  * Search: `Andrej Karpathy LLM YouTube`
  * Watch:

    * Intro-level talks (not math-heavy)

**Daily Question**

---

### 3️⃣ Scientific Paper Reading Skill (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Learn to convert theory → engineering decisions

**Free Sources**

* [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org)
* [https://scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com)

**How to Read (VERY IMPORTANT)**

* Read ONLY:

  * Abstract
  * Conclusion

**Write 3 bullets only**

* Problem
* Solution idea
* Limitation

---

### 4️⃣ Apply to Your Own Project (10–15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Fastest growth step

Using your **AI Blog Generator / AI Agent project**, write:

---

## 🚫 WHAT TO SKIP (IMPORTANT)

* Full ML math courses
* LeetCode grinding
* Model training
* Paid certificates

These are low ROI for your goal.

## 🧩 DAILY MENTAL MODEL (MEMORIZE THIS)

> "Senior engineers don’t build more — they prevent wrong building."

---

## ✅ 6-WEEK OUTCOME

After following this plan, you will be able to:

* Explain LLM limitations clearly
* Judge when automation adds no value
* Speak with architectural confidence
* Write technical justifications like senior engineers

---

## 📌 HOW TO USE THIS NOTE

* Open once per day
* Follow sections in order
* Do NOT add more resources
* Consistency > Quantity

---

*This note is designed to be revisited daily. Keep it simple. Keep it sharp.*
