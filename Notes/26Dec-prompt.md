I have multiple README files from different projects. For each README, extract the following information in a table:

1. **Project Name** – the name of the project.
2. **Purpose/Functionality** – a brief description of what the project does.
3. **Social Media Sharing or AI Agent** – whether the project has social media sharing functionality, or an AI agent for sharing content. If yes, give details; if no, write "No".

Output the results in a table like this:

| Project Name | Purpose/Functionality | Social Media Sharing or AI Agent |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |

Go through each README carefully and summarize accurately.
