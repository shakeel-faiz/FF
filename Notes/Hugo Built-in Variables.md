Here’s a clear, concise name you can use for that explanation:

> **“Comprehensive Guide to Hugo Built-in Variables”**

If you want a shorter or more practical title (for notes or documentation), here are a few good alternatives:

1. **Hugo Built-in Variables Cheat Sheet** ✅ *(best for reference)*
2. **Understanding Hugo’s Context Variables**
3. **Core Hugo Page and Site Variables Explained**
4. **Hugo Template Context Deep Dive**
5. **Hugo .Site, .Page, and .OutputFormats Explained**

---

Would you like me to turn it into a formatted **cheat sheet table** (one-page quick reference with examples)?
