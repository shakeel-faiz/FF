Learn about the Matroska Multimedia Container (MKV) format, its history, features and comparison with MP4. Explore the strengths and weaknesses of MKV and MP4 and learn when to choose MKV over MP4.

## What Is MKV Format? (Matroska Video File)

The MKV file format, also known as Matroska Multimedia Container, is a flexible and open standard multimedia container format. It is designed to hold numerous video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks in a single file, making it perfect for storing movies or TV shows with multiple audio tracks, subtitles, or alternative languages.

MKV files use an open standard and are not limited to any specific codec, allowing for greater flexibility during playback. They can contain virtually any type of media encoded using a variety of codecs, including popular ones like H.264 for video and AAC for audio, as well as less common or proprietary codecs.

The Matroska format, often abbreviated as MKV, is governed by the non-profit organization Association Loi 1901. It is licensed under GNU L-GPL for personal use. MKV is also available for commercial purposes under a BSD license, providing free parsing, analysis, and playback libraries.

The file extensions associated with the Matroska format include:

- ".mkv" for video files (which may also contain subtitles or audio).
- ".mk3d" for stereoscopic video files.
- ".mka" for audio-only files.
- ".mks" for subtitle-only files.

### MKV Short History and Goals

The Matroska multimedia container format, often abbreviated as MKV, originated in 2002 as an open and flexible standard for storing various types of multimedia content. It was developed by a group of enthusiasts seeking to address limitations in existing container formats like AVI and MP4. Matroska aimed to offer a modern, efficient, and extensible solution capable of accommodating a wide range of audio, video, subtitle, and metadata tracks within a single file.

One of the primary goals of Matroska was to provide a format that could store high-quality multimedia content without compromising on flexibility or compatibility. Unlike some proprietary formats, Matroska was designed to be open, meaning its specifications were freely available for anyone to use and implement. This openness fostered innovation and encouraged widespread adoption across different platforms and software applications.

Another key objective of Matroska was to support a diverse array of codecs and technologies, ensuring compatibility with both popular and emerging audio and video compression methods. This flexibility allowed content creators and consumers to use the codecs that best suited their needs without being constrained by the limitations of the container format itself.
