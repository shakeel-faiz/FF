## What Is MKV Format? (Matroska Video File)

The MKV file format, also known as Matroska Multimedia Container, is a flexible and open standard multimedia container format. It is designed to hold numerous video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks in a single file, making it perfect for storing movies or TV shows with multiple audio tracks, subtitles, or alternative languages.

MKV files use an open standard and are not limited to any specific codec, allowing for greater flexibility during playback. They can contain virtually any type of media encoded using a variety of codecs, including popular ones like H.264 for video and AAC for audio, as well as less common or proprietary codecs.

The Matroska format, often abbreviated as MKV, is governed by the non-profit organization Association Loi 1901. It is licensed under GNU L-GPL for personal use. MKV is also available for commercial purposes under a BSD license, providing free parsing, analysis, and playback libraries.

The file extensions associated with the Matroska format include:

- ".mkv" for video files (which may also contain subtitles or audio).
- ".mk3d" for stereoscopic video files.
- ".mka" for audio-only files.
- ".mks" for subtitle-only files.
