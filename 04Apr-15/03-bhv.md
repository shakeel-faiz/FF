## What is a BVH file?

BVH, short for Biovision Hierarchy, is a file format crucial for storing motion capture data used in animations. Primarily employed in computer graphics and animation software, BVH files organize movement details of characters or objects in a hierarchical structure. Each bone within this structure is defined by its name, relationships with other bones, and rotational keyframes that outline its motion over time. 

This format serves as a standardized method for exchanging motion data across different software platforms like Autodesk Maya, Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine. BVH files originate from motion capture sessions, capturing intricate actions like walking, running, or complex gestures performed by actors and then applied to virtual entities in animations or simulations. 

Once imported into animation software, animators can further refine these motions by adjusting keyframes, modifying bone arrangements, or blending various motions to achieve realistic and expressive animations. BVH files typically use the ".bvh" file extension.

## How to open BHV file?

To open and work with BVH (Biovision Hierarchy) files, you typically need animation or 3D modeling software that supports this file format. Hereâ€™s a general outline of how you can open and use BVH files:

1.  **Animation Software**: Use animation software such as Autodesk Maya, Blender, or MotionBuilder. These programs are commonly used in the animation industry and support importing BVH files.
    
2.  **Importing BVH Files**:
    
    -   In Autodesk Maya: Go to `File` > `Import` and select the BVH file from your computer. Maya will import the BVH data, allowing you to view and edit the animation.
        
    -   In Blender: Go to `File` > `Import` > `Motion Capture (.bvh)`. Navigate to your BVH file and select it. Blender will import the BVH data, which you can then work with in the 3D viewport.
        
    -   In MotionBuilder: Go to `File` > `Import` and choose the BVH file. MotionBuilder specializes in handling motion capture data, so it provides robust tools for viewing and editing BVH animations.
        
3.  **Manipulating Animation**:
    
    -   Once imported, you can manipulate the BVH animation within the software. This includes adjusting keyframes, modifying bone hierarchies, applying additional animations, or exporting the modified animation data for use in other projects.
4.  **Playback and Preview**: Most software allows you to preview the BVH animation in real-time within the viewport. This helps in assessing the quality of the motion capture data and making necessary adjustments.
    
5.  **Exporting**: After editing or modifying the BVH animation, you can export it back to the BVH format or to other animation formats supported by your software, depending on your project requirements.
