# Excel VBA Password Remover for XLSM: Unlock Your Files Easily

Have you ever found yourself locked out of an Excel VBA project because you can't remember the password? It's a frustrating situation, especially when you need to access or modify the code within an XLSM file. Fortunately, there's a solution: using an Excel VBA password remover.

In this blog, we'll dive into the essentials of removing passwords from VBA projects in Excel, focusing on the XLSM file format. 

## Understanding XLSM Files and VBA Projects

Before we jump into the password removal process, it's important to understand what we're dealing with. An XLSM file is an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook, which means it contains VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code that automates tasks and adds functionality to your spreadsheets. VBA projects within these files are often password-protected to safeguard the code from unauthorized access or modifications.

## Why Would You Need an Excel VBA Password Remover?

There are several reasons why you might need to use an Excel VBA password remover for XLSM files:

1.  **Lost Password**: You’ve forgotten the password and can no longer access the VBA project.
2.  **Inherited Files**: You’ve received a file from a colleague or client with a locked VBA project, and they didn’t provide the password.
3.  **Code Recovery**: You need to recover or modify the code inside the VBA project to fix bugs or enhance functionality.

## How to Remove Excel VBA Passwords from XLSM Files

Here's a step-by-step guide to using an Excel VBA password remover for XLSM files:

1.  **Backup Your File**: Before you begin, it's crucial to create a backup of your original XLSM file. This ensures that you can restore the file if anything goes wrong during the password removal process.
    
2.  **Use a Hex Editor**: One method to remove the password involves using a hex editor. Open your XLSM file in a hex editor and search for specific hex strings that correspond to the password. You can replace these strings with a standard hex value, effectively removing the password. This method requires some technical know-how and isn't foolproof.
    
3.  **Password Remover Tools**: Several third-party tools are available specifically for removing VBA passwords from Excel files. These tools are usually user-friendly and do not require deep technical knowledge. Simply open the XLSM file in the tool, and it will remove the password, allowing you to access the VBA project. ***Please read about the list of these tools in next section***.
    
4.  **Open the Unprotected VBA Project**: Once the password is removed, open the XLSM file in Excel and access the VBA project without any restrictions. You can now edit the code, add new macros, or do whatever you need to with your VBA project.
    
5.  **Re-Secure the VBA Project**: If you still want to protect your VBA code, consider setting a new password after making your changes. Be sure to store this password securely to avoid future lockouts.
