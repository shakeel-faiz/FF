## What is JFIF - JPEG File Interchange Format?

The **JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF)** is a type of image file format that adds extra features to the basic JPEG format. It's recognized under some technical standards, but basically, it helps handle things like resolution, aspect ratio, and color better than the original JPEG format. Even though it's not the very first JPEG standard, it's still commonly used and labeled as "image/jpeg." ***One thing to note is that JFIF doesn't work well with a newer format called Exif, which is often used in modern digital cameras.***

## How JFIF Enhances JPEG

***What JFIF Fixes***: JFIF fills in some gaps that the basic JPEG standard doesn't cover.

- **Aligning Image Components**: JPEG lets different parts of an image (like color channels) have different resolutions but doesn't explain how to line them up. JFIF solves this by ensuring everything is properly aligned so the image looks correct. 
- **Handling Resolution and Aspect Ratio**: JPEG doesn't handle resolution or aspect ratio details. JFIF adds this info using a special section in the file, making it easy to spot a JFIF file. However, many digital cameras (which use Exif) skip this section.
- **Defining Color Handling**: JPEG doesn't specify how to manage colors, but JFIF does. It uses a color model called YCbCr for color images and ensures all color levels are fully used, from black to white. This differs from older TV standards. You can improve color accuracy in a JFIF image by embedding extra color info, like an ICC profile or an sRGB tag.
