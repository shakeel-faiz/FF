The user can also create a NOMEDIA file using a file manager app to hide the multimedia files in a particular folder.

## NOMEDIA file in WhatsApp

WhatsApp uses NOMEDIA files to hide its media files, such as images, videos, and audio files, from the Android device's gallery app. This is done to maintain the privacy of the user's WhatsApp media files and to prevent them from being accidentally shared or displayed to others. When you receive media files in WhatsApp, they are stored in a hidden folder on your device's storage, which includes a NOMEDIA file. This prevents the media files from being displayed in the gallery app, music player, or any other media application. However, you can still view and play these media files within WhatsApp itself.

If you want to view your WhatsApp media files outside of WhatsApp, you can use a file manager app to navigate to the WhatsApp media folder on your device's storage. The folder will be located in the WhatsApp folder, which is usually in the root directory of your device's internal storage. Once you have located the media files, you can copy or move them to another folder or share them with others as desired. However, if you want to continue to hide your WhatsApp media files from other media applications, it is recommended that you do not delete the NOMEDIA file in the WhatsApp media folder.
