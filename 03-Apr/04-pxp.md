## What is a PXP file?

A PXP file is a game configuration file used by PODBot, a bot plugin for the popular first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike. PODBot allows players to add computer-controlled bots to their Counter-Strike games, providing an additional challenge and allowing them to play even when other players are not available. The PXP file contains the settings and configuration information for the bots, including their skill level, behavior, and other attributes. These files can be customized by players to create their own custom bots, or downloaded from online sources to add pre-made bots to their games.

PODBot is a plugin for the popular first-person shooter game Counter-Strike that allows players to add computer-controlled bots to their games. The plugin was created by Stefan Hendricks in 2002 and has been maintained and updated by a community of developers ever since. "POD" in PODBots stands for "Playing Opposing Defense" Bot. PODBot is designed to provide a challenging and realistic bot gameplay experience, with bots that can move, shoot, and interact with the game environment much like human players. The plugin includes a variety of features, including customizable bot behaviors and skill levels, team coordination, and support for various game modes.

Players can use PXP files to customize the bot settings and behaviors, allowing them to create their own custom bots or download pre-made bots from online sources. This makes PODBots a popular choice for players who want to practice their gameplay skills or play the game when other human players are not available.
