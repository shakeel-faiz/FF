## What is a MCSTRUCTURE file?

MCSTRUCTURE is a file extension used by Minecraft, a popular sandbox video game, to store custom structures and buildings created by players. When players create custom structures or buildings using Minecraft's built-in tools, such as the Structure Block, they can save their creations as MCSTRUCTURE files. These files contain all the necessary data and metadata required to recreate the structure in the game world, including the location, size, and orientation of each block used in the structure. MCSTRUCTURE files can be imported and exported from Minecraft using various third-party tools and mods, making it easy for players to share their creations with others or use them in different game worlds.
