## What is a TTR file?

A TTR file is a game replay file created by TETR.IO, an online multiplayer Tetris game. TETR.IO saves replays of players' games in the form of TTR files, which can be watched later to review their gameplay or share with others.

## TTR File Format - More Information

TETR.IO is a modern interpretation of the classic Tetris game, featuring competitive multiplayer gameplay with customizable controls, game modes, and other features. When a player completes a game in TETR.IO, the game records all the moves they made during that game, and saves it in a TTR file. The TTR file contains information about the game, such as the player's score, time played, and the sequence of blocks used.

TETR.IO allows players to import TTR files to replay their own games, as well as other players' games. This is useful for reviewing gameplay to identify areas for improvement, or to learn new strategies and techniques from other players.

TETR.IO also features a leaderboard system that tracks players' scores and other stats, allowing players to compete with each other for the top spots on the leaderboard. TTR files can be shared with other players, allowing them to watch and learn from each other's gameplay, and contribute to the growing community of TETR.IO players.

## How to open TTR file?

To open a TTR file, you will need to have TETR.IO installed on your computer. Once you have TETR.IO installed, follow these steps to open a TTR file:

1. Launch TETR.IO on your computer.
2. Log in to your account or create a new one if you haven't already.
3. Click on the "Replays" button in the main menu to open the replay selection screen.
4. Click on the "Import" button at the top of the screen.
5. Browse to the location on your computer where the TTR file is saved, select it, and click on "Open."
6. TETR.IO will start importing the replay, which may take a few moments depending on the length of the replay.
7. Once the import is complete, the replay will appear in your list of replays, and you can click on it to watch it.

You can only open TTR files within TETR.IO, as they are specific to the game and cannot be opened with other software.
