## What is a ZOO file?

A `.zoo` file is an archive format that is used to compress and store files and directories. It is similar to other archive formats like `.zip`, `.tar`, and `.rar`. The `.zoo` format was popular in the early days of computing but has become less common in recent years. It was originally developed by Rahul Dhesi and was used primarily on Unix and DOS systems.

A `.zoo` file typically contains one or more files and directories that have been compressed and archived into a single file. You can create and extract `.zoo` files using various software tools that support this format. Here are some common operations associated with `.zoo` files:

1.  Creating a `.zoo` file: You can use a command-line utility like "zoo" to create a `.zoo` file. For example, the following command will create a `.zoo` archive from a directory:
    
    `zoo a -c archive.zoo directory/` 
    
    In this command, "a" stands for "add," "-c" specifies compression, and "archive.zoo" is the name of the output archive.
    
2.  Extracting files from a `.zoo` file: To extract the contents of a `.zoo` archive, you can use a command like this:
    
    `zoo e archive.zoo` 
    
    This command will extract the files from the `archive.zoo` file.
    
3.  Listing the contents of a `.zoo` file: You can list the contents of a `.zoo` archive without extracting them using the "l" option:
    
    
    `zoo l archive.zoo`
