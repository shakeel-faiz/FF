## What is a ZOO file?

A `.zoo` file is an archive format that is used to compress and store files and directories. It is similar to other archive formats like `.zip`, `.tar`, and `.rar`. The `.zoo` format was popular in the early days of computing but has become less common in recent years. It was originally developed by Rahul Dhesi and was used primarily on Unix and DOS systems.

A `.zoo` file typically contains one or more files and directories that have been compressed and archived into a single file. You can create and extract `.zoo` files using various software tools that support this format. 

ZOO archives have a unique feature that allows them to store multiple versions of the same file, provided each version was modified on a different date. This means that ZOO users can save and access previous iterations of a file directly from the ZOO archive. This feature enables users to revert to an earlier version of a file or compare an older version with a more recent one, offering a convenient way to manage file revisions and changes over time.

## Common operations of ZOO files

Here are some common operations associated with `.zoo` files:

1.  **Creating a `.zoo` file:** You can use a command-line utility like "zoo" to create a `.zoo` file. For example, the following command will create a `.zoo` archive from a directory:
    
    `zoo a -c archive.zoo directory/` 
    
    In this command, "a" stands for "add," "-c" specifies compression, and "archive.zoo" is the name of the output archive.
    
2.  **Extracting files from a `.zoo` file:** To extract the contents of a `.zoo` archive, you can use a command like this:
    
    `zoo e archive.zoo` 
    
    This command will extract the files from the `archive.zoo` file.
    
3.  **Listing the contents of a `.zoo` file:** You can list the contents of a `.zoo` archive without extracting them using the "l" option:
    
    
    `zoo l archive.zoo`
