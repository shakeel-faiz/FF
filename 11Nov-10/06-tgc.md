## What is a TGC file?

A `.tgc` file is associated with Terragen, a landscape generation and rendering software primarily used for creating realistic natural environments and landscapes. The ".tgc" file extension stands for "Terragen Node Clip File."

In Terragen, a node clip is a way to save specific set of nodes and their configurations in node network. Node networks in Terragen are used to create complex landscapes by connecting various nodes that control terrain generation, shading and other aspects of scene.

Saving a node clip as `.tgc` file allows you to reuse specific configurations or parts of your node network in other projects; this can be time-saving feature especially when you have complex node setups that you want to use in multiple scenes.

## How to use TGC file?

To use a `.tgc` file in Terragen, you can typically do following:

1.  Open Terragen.
2.  Create a new project or open an existing one.
3.  In the Node Network Editor, you can import a `.tgc` file by right-clicking and selecting an option like "Import Node Clip" or something similar.
4.  Browse your computer to locate and select the `.tgc` file you want to import.
5.  The node clip will then appear in your Node Network Editor, and you can connect it to other nodes as needed.

This feature allows for a modular approach to building landscapes, making it easier to manage and reuse complex node setups.

## Terragen

Terragen is a versatile 3D modeling and rendering software designed for creation of highly realistic natural environments and landscapes. It excels in generation of intricate terrains enabling users to sculpt landscapes, import heightmaps or generate terrains procedurally. Terragen is node-based workflow allows users to construct complex scenes by connecting various nodes that control terrain generation, shading, lighting, atmosphere and other environmental elements. The software is renowned for its capacity to produce photorealistic images, simulating natural lighting, atmospheric effects and terrain materials; it also includes tools for simulating atmospheres, ecosystems for populating scenes with vegetation and supports animation for dynamic landscapes and natural events. With extensive export options and integration into professional workflows, Terragen is a valuable tool for artists, animators and visual effects professionals seeking to create stunning and lifelike natural landscapes and environments in their projects.
