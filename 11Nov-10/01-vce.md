## What is a VCE file?

A VCE file is a digital exam format generated using the **Visual CertExam Suite**, a software package that combines the functionality of **Visual CertExam Designer** and **Visual CertExam Manager**. This digital file format is designed to encapsulate a comprehensive set of questions and their corresponding answer choices, allowing for the assembly of a complete practice or certification examination.

A .VCE file is typically associated with VCE (Visual CertExam) software, which is used for creating, editing and taking practice exams. VCE files contain a collection of questions and answers and they are often used by students and professionals to prepare for various certification exams or tests.
