## What is a PVT file?

A PVT file is a type of picture and video combo called a Live Photo, made by an iPhone. Usually, Live Photos have a different name like .HEIC, but sometimes when you share them using services like AirDrop, they might end up with a .pvt extension by mistake. Normally, when you send a Live Photo, it should be in .HEIC format (or changed to .JPG in some cases). For instance, if you AirDrop it to a Mac, it should show up as an HEIC file. But occasionally, it might turn into a PVT file.

## About Live Photos

Live Photos is a feature integrated into Apple's iPhones that enhances traditional still photography by capturing a brief video clip alongside static image. To activate this feature, users need to ensure that Live Photos icon, often represented by concentric circles, is highlighted or yellow in Camera app. Once enabled, taking a photo will record a short video snippet spanning a few seconds before and after pressing shutter button, providing a dynamic element to captured moment.

When viewing Live Photos in Photos app on the iPhone, users can experience added dimension by pressing and holding on image. This action triggers playback of embedded video clip, accompanied by any sound recorded during photo capture. The Live Photo feature adds an interactive and immersive aspect to photo-viewing experience.

Sharing Live Photos involves sending a combined package that includes both the still image and associated video clip. When shared through messaging or email, recipient can typically view the Live Photo in its dynamic form. Platforms or devices that do not support Live Photos, they may be displayed as regular still images without animated component.

Live Photos can be seamlessly enjoyed across various Apple devices, including Mac computers and iPads, as long as they support feature. When transferring Live Photos to a Mac, the files are usually stored as HEIC (image) and MOV (video) formats, maintaining the integrated nature of Live Photo.
