## What is a PVT file?

A PVT file is a type of picture and video combo called a Live Photo, made by an iPhone. Usually, Live Photos have a different name like .HEIC, but sometimes when you share them using services like AirDrop, they might end up with a .pvt extension by mistake. Normally, when you send a Live Photo, it should be in the .HEIC format (or changed to .JPG in some cases). For instance, if you AirDrop it to a Mac, it should show up as an HEIC file. But occasionally, it might turn into a PVT file.

## About Live Photos

Live Photos is a feature integrated into Apple's iPhones that enhances traditional still photography by capturing a brief video clip alongside the static image. To activate this feature, users need to ensure that the Live Photos icon, often represented by concentric circles, is highlighted or yellow in the Camera app. Once enabled, taking a photo will record a short video snippet spanning a few seconds before and after pressing the shutter button, providing a dynamic element to the captured moment.

When viewing Live Photos in the Photos app on the iPhone, users can experience the added dimension by pressing and holding on the image. This action triggers the playback of the embedded video clip, accompanied by any sound recorded during the photo capture. The Live Photo feature adds an interactive and immersive aspect to the photo-viewing experience.

Sharing Live Photos involves sending a combined package that includes both the still image and the associated video clip. When shared through messaging or email, the recipient can typically view the Live Photo in its dynamic form. However, it's important to note that on platforms or devices that do not support Live Photos, they may be displayed as regular still images without the animated component.

Live Photos can be seamlessly enjoyed across various Apple devices, including Mac computers and iPads, as long as they support the feature. When transferring Live Photos to a Mac, the files are usually stored as HEIC (image) and MOV (video) formats, maintaining the integrated nature of the Live Photo.
