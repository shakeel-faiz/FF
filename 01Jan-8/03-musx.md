## What is a MUSX file?

A MUSX file with .musx file extension is like a digital sheet of music created using a program called MakeMusic Finale. This file includes everything needed for a musical piece, like the notes, timing, and symbols. It is not just the music itself; it also has details like the title, composer's name, and copyright information.

People who compose music use MakeMusic Finale to make, edit, and listen to their musical creations. For example, someone might use Finale to write a new version of a song, add lyrics to it and then play it on their computer to make sure everything sounds right.

When composers save their work in Finale, it is saved as a MUSX file. Inside this file, there is not only the musical notes but also data that helps Finale play back the music when you want to listen to it.
