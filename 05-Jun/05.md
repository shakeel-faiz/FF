## What is an OGV file?

The OGV file format, also known as Ogg Video, is a container format designed to hold video and audio data. It is part of Ogg multimedia framework, which was developed by Xiph.Org Foundation. The OGV format is based on open-source Ogg container and typically uses Theora video codec and Vorbis audio codec.

The Theora video codec is a free and open video compression format, which provides reasonable video quality and is suitable for web streaming and other applications. The Vorbis audio codec, also open and free, is commonly used for encoding high-quality audio.
