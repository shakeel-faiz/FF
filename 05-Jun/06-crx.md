## What is a CRX file?

CRX file format is associated with Google Chrome browser extensions. A CRX file is essentially a compressed package containing necessary files and metadata for an extension to be installed and run in Google Chrome. It enhances the functionality or appearance of a web browser by providing an extra feature or theme. 

When a CRX file is downloaded and installed in Google Chrome, the browser verifies the extension's integrity using public key and signature. If verification is successful, Chrome extracts the contents of CRX file and installs the extension, making it available for use. Users can manage their extensions through Chrome Extensions page, which allows enabling, disabling or removing installed extensions.
