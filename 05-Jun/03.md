## What is a NSP file?

NSP file format is primarily associated with Nintendo Switch console. NSP stands for "Nintendo Submission Package." It is file format used by Nintendo for distributing and installing games, updates and DLC (Downloadable Content) on Nintendo Switch system.

NSP files are essentially containers that contain all necessary data and assets for particular game or content. This includes game executable, graphics, audio and any additional files required for game to run. NSP files can be installed on Nintendo Switch through various means including official Nintendo eShop or custom homebrew software.

NSP files are typically encrypted or signed with digital signature to prevent unauthorized distribution or tampering. This ensures that only legitimate copies of games or content can be installed and run on Nintendo Switch console.

## How to open NSP file?

NSP files are designed to be installed and run on Nintendo Switch console, so they cannot be directly opened or executed on computer or other devices without appropriate software or hardware emulation.

However, there are few software tools and utilities available that can handle NSP files for various purposes, such as extracting or manipulating content within files. Here are few examples:

- **Hactool:** Hactool is command-line utility that allows you to view contents of NSP files, extract individual files, or decrypt/encrypt files. It is primarily used for homebrew development or research purposes.
- **NUT:** NUT is graphical user interface (GUI) tool built on top of Hactool. It provides more user-friendly interface for managing NSP files, including the ability to extract files, display metadata and manage updates and DLC.
- **Tinfoil:** Tinfoil is homebrew application for Nintendo Switch that can install NSP files from various sources, including USB, SD card or network. It also has features like title management, firmware updates and more.
