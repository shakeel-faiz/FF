## What is a PAR file?

The Dedicated Micros DVRs utilize a proprietary digital video format known as NetVu for recording and storing video footage. Additionally, the DVR systems utilize .par files, which are configuration files specific to Dedicated Micros DVRs. These files store settings, parameters, and configurations for the DVR system, such as camera settings, recording schedules, and network configurations.

The .par files can be downloaded to a computer along with the recorded video files using the NetVu software. By importing a .par file into the NetVu software, the settings and configurations stored in the file can be applied to the DVR system, allowing for easy replication or restoration of specific system configurations.

Furthermore, the NetVu software provides the capability to export and import .par files, enabling users to share or transfer system configurations between different DVR systems. This feature is particularly useful when setting up multiple DVRs with consistent settings or when migrating configurations to new DVR units.
