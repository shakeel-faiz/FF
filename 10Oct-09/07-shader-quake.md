## What is a SHADER file?

The SHADER file format is used in the **Quake 3 engine** to define shaders for textures and materials in the game. Shaders are used to specify how a surface should be rendered, including its appearance, reflectivity, transparency, and other visual properties. 

## Quake 3 Engine SHADER File

Here is a basic overview of the structure and syntax of a Quake 3 engine shader file:

```Plain Text
// Comments can be added with double slashes

// A shader is defined with the "shader" keyword followed by the shader name
shader shader_name
{
    // Properties and stages of the shader are defined within curly braces

    // The properties for this shader are specified using key-value pairs
    // Common properties include surfaceparm, cull, deformvertexes, q3map_*, etc.

    // Example properties:
    surfaceparm nolightmap
    cull disable

    // Stages of the shader are defined using the stage keyword
    stage
    {
        // The properties for this stage are also specified using key-value pairs

        // Example stage properties:
        texture texture_filename
        // texture is used to specify the image file for this stage

        // Additional properties for this stage can include blending modes,
        // scrolling, scaling, and other texture manipulation settings.
        // These can be specified with key-value pairs.

        // Example stage properties:
        blendFunc GL_DST_COLOR GL_SRC_COLOR
        // Specifies a blending mode

        tcMod scroll 0.1 0.1
        // Scrolls the texture in the S and T direction

        tcMod scale 2 2
        // Scales the texture

        // You can have multiple stages within a shader, each with its own properties
    }
}
```

In a Quake 3 engine shader file, you can define multiple shaders, each with its own set of properties and stages. These shaders are used to define the appearance of different textures and materials in the game world. The engine uses this information to render surfaces with the specified visual effects and behaviors.
