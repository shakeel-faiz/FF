## What is a CHR file?

CHR file format is associated with 3ds Max, a powerful software used for 3D modeling, rendering, and animation. These files serve as repositories for three-dimensional character models, which can encompass both static and animated characters. Inside a ".chr" file, you'll find a comprehensive representation of the character, including its geometry (shape and structure), textures (surface appearance), lighting effects, and various other properties related to the 3D model.

These character models are instrumental in the creation of characters that find their way into various media forms, such as video games, movies, and television productions. By encapsulating all the essential visual and structural elements within a ".chr" file, 3D artists and animators can efficiently develop and manipulate characters for use in these different forms of entertainment.
