## What is a CHR file?

CHR file in the context of CryENGINE refers to a **CryENGINE Character File**. CryENGINE is a game engine developed by Crytek, and these files are used for storing character models and associated data for use in video games and other real-time applications.

A CryENGINE Character File typically contains the following components:

1.  **Character Model**: This is the 3D model of the character, including its geometry, textures, and animations. These models are often created using software like Autodesk Maya or Blender and then imported into CryENGINE.
    
2.  **Animation Data**: CryENGINE supports complex animations for characters, so the ".chr" file may include various animations such as walking, running, jumping, and more. These animations are typically stored as keyframe data.
    
3.  **Rigging Information**: Rigging refers to the process of creating a skeleton structure for a character model, which allows for animations to be applied to the model. The ".chr" file may contain information about the bone hierarchy and how the character's mesh is connected to this skeleton.
    
4.  **Material and Texture Data**: Information about the materials used on the character model and the associated texture maps may be included in the ".chr" file. CryENGINE supports physically-based rendering, so these materials can be quite detailed.
    
5.  **Physics Data**: If the character is intended to interact with the game world, the ".chr" file might include physics data such as collision shapes or constraints for ragdoll physics.
    
6.  **Configuration Settings**: Various configuration settings related to the character's behavior in the game world, such as AI behavior or scripted events, may also be part of the ".chr" file.

## CryENGINE

CryENGINE is a powerful game engine developed by Crytek, a German video game company. It is known for its cutting-edge graphics capabilities and has been used to create some visually stunning and technologically advanced video games. Here are some key features and information about CryENGINE:

1.  **Graphics and Rendering**: CryENGINE is renowned for its advanced graphics capabilities. It supports features like real-time global illumination, high-quality dynamic lighting and shadows, physically-based rendering (PBR), and high-resolution textures. These features contribute to creating visually stunning and realistic game worlds.
    
2.  **Physics Engine**: CryENGINE includes a built-in physics engine that allows for realistic interactions between objects in the game world. It supports features like rigid body physics, soft body physics, and ragdoll physics, making it suitable for creating dynamic and immersive environments.
    
3.  **Terrain and Vegetation**: CryENGINE provides tools for creating vast and detailed outdoor environments. It supports terrain editing, vegetation placement, and dynamic weather systems, allowing developers to create expansive and realistic outdoor settings.
    
4.  **Character Animation**: CryENGINE includes robust tools for character animation. It supports complex character rigs, facial animation, and a blend tree system that enables developers to create lifelike character movements and animations.
    
5.  **AI System**: The engine features an AI system that allows for the creation of intelligent NPCs (non-player characters) and enemy AI. Developers can script AI behavior and interactions to create challenging and immersive gameplay experiences.
       
6.  **Scripting**: CryENGINE uses a scripting language called "Schematyc" that allows developers to create gameplay logic and interactions. Additionally, it supports C++ for more advanced programming needs.

## File Formats Used by CryENGINE

Here are some of the common file types associated with CryENGINE:

1.  **cryproj**: CryENGINE project files. These files store project-specific settings and configurations for a particular game project.
    
2.  **.level**: Level files contain the 3D game world data, including terrain, objects, lighting, and other level-specific settings. Levels are a fundamental component of game design in CryENGINE.
    
3.  **.cgf**: Character Geometry Format. These files contain 3D model data for characters, objects, and other game assets. CGF files can include geometry, textures, and animation data.
    
4.  **.chrparams**: Character parameters files. These files store settings and configurations for character models and their animations.
    
5.  **.dds**: DirectX Texture Format. CryENGINE commonly uses DDS files to store textures, including diffuse maps, normal maps, and other texture types.
    
6.  **.cryshader**: CryENGINE Shader files. These files define how materials and objects are rendered in the game world, specifying shaders, material properties, and more.
    
7.  **.crytif**: Texture Information File. These files store additional information about textures, such as compression settings, mipmaps, and other texture-related details.
    
8.  **.cdf**: Character Definition File. CDF files are used to define character assets and their properties, including attachments, animation states, and character-related settings.
    
9.  **.dds**: CryENGINE also uses DDS (DirectDraw Surface) files for various texture maps, such as normal maps, specular maps, and diffuse maps.
    
10.  **.anim**: Animation files. These files store animation data for characters and objects, including keyframes, bone positions, and animation sequences.
    
11.  **.xml**: XML files may be used for various configurations and data definitions within CryENGINE, such as game logic, AI behavior, and more.
    
12.  **.pak**: [PAK files](/game/pak/) are archive files used to package game assets and resources, making it more efficient for game distribution and loading.
