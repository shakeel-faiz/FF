## What is a CHR file?

CHR file in the context of CryENGINE refers to a **CryENGINE Character File**. CryENGINE is a game engine developed by Crytek, and these files are used for storing character models and associated data for use in video games and other real-time applications.

A CryENGINE Character File typically contains the following components:

1.  **Character Model**: This is the 3D model of the character, including its geometry, textures, and animations. These models are often created using software like Autodesk Maya or Blender and then imported into CryENGINE.
    
2.  **Animation Data**: CryENGINE supports complex animations for characters, so the ".chr" file may include various animations such as walking, running, jumping, and more. These animations are typically stored as keyframe data.
    
3.  **Rigging Information**: Rigging refers to the process of creating a skeleton structure for a character model, which allows for animations to be applied to the model. The ".chr" file may contain information about the bone hierarchy and how the character's mesh is connected to this skeleton.
    
4.  **Material and Texture Data**: Information about the materials used on the character model and the associated texture maps may be included in the ".chr" file. CryENGINE supports physically-based rendering, so these materials can be quite detailed.
    
5.  **Physics Data**: If the character is intended to interact with the game world, the ".chr" file might include physics data such as collision shapes or constraints for ragdoll physics.
    
6.  **Configuration Settings**: Various configuration settings related to the character's behavior in the game world, such as AI behavior or scripted events, may also be part of the ".chr" file.
