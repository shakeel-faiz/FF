## What is a CFG file?

CFG is also a a LightWave Configuration File, also known as a "Preferences file". It is a vital component in the world of LightWave 3D. LightWave 3D is a versatile software application designed for both modeling and rendering, enabling users to create captivating still images and dynamic animation sequences.

The purpose of these configuration files is to store a wide range of application-specific settings and options. These settings can include preferences related to the software's interface layout, tool behavior, content directories, scripting capabilities, and even licensing information.

## LightWave Configuration File

LightWave is a 3D modeling and animation software developed by NewTek. It uses configuration files to store various settings and preferences. These configuration files can be modified to customize the behavior and appearance of the software. Here are some common configuration files and their locations:

1.  **LightWave Layout Configuration**:
    
    -   **Layout3.CFG**: This file contains configuration settings for the layout interface of LightWave, including window positions, menu layouts, and custom keyboard shortcuts.

2.  **LightWave Modeler Configuration**:
    
    -   **Modeler3.CFG**: This file contains configuration settings for the modeler interface of LightWave, including preferences related to modeling tools and options.

3.  **Content Directory Configuration**:
    
    -   **Content_Dir.cfg**: This file defines the paths to content directories, such as where LightWave looks for textures, objects, and other assets.

4.  **Hub Configuration**:
    
    -   **Hub.cfg**: The Hub is a component of LightWave used for managing scene and asset files. This configuration file contains settings related to the Hub's operation.

5.  **LScript Configuration**:
    
    -   **LScript.cfg**: LightWave supports scripting using LScript. This file contains settings related to LScript, such as script paths and other preferences.

## LightWave

LightWave is a 3D computer graphics software package developed by NewTek.
