## What is a CFG file?

CFG file is also known as the **"Wesnoth Markup Language" (WML)**. It is a custom markup language used primarily in the game "Battle for Wesnoth", which is a turn-based strategy game. WML is used to define and customize various aspects of the game, including scenarios, campaigns, units, and more. It is a way for modders and developers to create content for the game.

It is written in a format that resembles a combination of XML and simple scripting. Here is overview of some common elements and structures you might find in a WML file:

1.  **Tags:** WML uses tags to define different elements in the game. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets. For example:

```
[unit]
    type=Elvish Archer
    hitpoints=25
[/unit]
```
    
2.  **Attributes:** Within tags, you can define attributes to specify properties or values associated with the element. In the example above, "type" and "hitpoints" are attributes.
    
3.  **Arrays and Arrays of Arrays:** You can create arrays of data and even arrays of arrays to define lists of units, terrain types, or other game elements.
    
4.  **Conditional Statements:** WML supports conditional statements to control the flow of the game. For example:

```
[if]
    condition=have_unit
    variable=x,y
[/if]
```
    
5.  **Loops:** You can use loops to iterate through lists of items or perform actions repeatedly.
    
6.  **Includes:** You can include other WML files within a main WML file to organize and modularize your content.
    
7.  **Event Handlers:** You can define event handlers to trigger actions when specific events occur in the game.
    

Here is a simplified example of a WML file that defines a custom unit:

```
[unit_type]
    id=my_custom_unit
    name="Custom Unit"
    description="A unit created using WML."
    image="units/my_custom_unit.png"
    hitpoints=30
    movement_type=foot
[/unit_type]
```
