## What is a FLA file?

The .fla file format is associated with Adobe Animate, formerly known as Adobe Flash Professional. It is the primary file format used by the software to store and organize multimedia projects such as animations, interactive applications and games.

The .fla file format is based on binary file structure and contains various elements, including graphics, animation timelines, scripting code, sound files and other assets used in project. It serves as editable source file for creating and authoring multimedia content.

Adobe Animate allows users to create complex animations and interactive experiences by leveraging combination of vector graphics, bitmap images and timeline-based animation techniques. The .fla file format retains all the project's details, allowing users to make changes, add or remove elements and modify various aspects of the project during authoring process.

When a project is ready for deployment or distribution, it can be published or exported from FLA into different formats such as .SWF (Shockwave Flash) or HTML5 which are more widely supported by web browsers and other platforms.
