## What is a XEM file?

XEM file is XML metadata interchange file that can be used to export metadata information about PowerDesigner model to external file. XEM file includes information about the model including entities, relationships, keys, diagrams and other relevant metadata. The file can be used to transfer or share model with other users or systems or to create a backup of the model for safekeeping.

To export PowerDesigner model to .xem file, you can go to File menu and select "Export" and then "XML Metadata Interchange". You can then select specific elements of model that you want to export and save resulting .xem file to desired location.

Similarly, you can import .xem file into PowerDesigner model by selecting "Import" from the File menu and then choosing "XML Metadata Interchange" option. You can then select .xem file to import and choose specific elements to import into your model.

The .xem file format is a useful feature of PowerDesigner that enables users to share and transfer metadata information between different systems or users.

## What is the format of XEM file?

The format of XEM file is text based which means it can be opened or edited using any text editor e.g. Notepad, Notepad++ etc. The format follows XML standard which is a widely used standard to store and exchange data between different systems.

## XEM File Format - More Information

When you export PowerDesigner model to .xem file, you can choose which specific metadata information to include in the export. This can be useful if you only want to transfer certain elements of model or if you want to reduce file size of exported .xem file.

When you import .xem file into PowerDesigner model, you have the option to choose which specific elements of the model to import. This can be useful if you only want to import certain elements of model or if you want to merge imported elements with existing elements in the model.

## What does XEM file contain?

XEM file in PowerDesigner contains metadata information about PowerDesigner model. This metadata information includes:

- **Entities:** The .xem file contains information about entities in model including their names, descriptions and attributes.
- **Attributes:** The .xem file contains information about attributes of each entity, including their names, data types and constraints.
- **Relationships:** The .xem file contains information about relationships between entities, including their types, cardinalities and foreign keys.
- **Keys:** The .xem file contains information about the keys used in model, including primary keys and unique keys.
- **Diagrams:** The .xem file contains information about diagrams in model, including their names, descriptions, and layout.
- **Customizations:** The .xem file can also contain information about any customizations or modifications made to the model, including user-defined data types, domains, and templates.

The specific elements and details included in .xem file can vary depending on the settings and options selected during export process. When importing an .xem file into a new model, you can choose which specific elements to include, allowing you to merge the imported elements with the existing model in flexible way.
