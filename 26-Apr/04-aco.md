## What is an ACO file?

An ACO file is a color swatch file used by Adobe Photoshop and other Adobe Creative Suite applications to store and share color palettes. A color swatch is set of predefined colors that can be used consistently across multiple projects or designs.

An ACO file typically contains list of color values in various formats such as hexadecimal or RGB values and can be created or edited using Adobe Photoshop's Color Palette Editor. ACO files can be imported into other Adobe applications such as Illustrator, InDesign and Premiere Pro for consistent color usage.

To load ACO file into Photoshop, go to Swatches panel and click on panel menu. Then select "Load Swatches" and choose ACO file you want to import. The color swatches will then be added to Swatches panel for use in your designs.

## ACO File Format - More Information

An ACO file is a binary file format used by Adobe Photoshop and other Adobe Creative Suite applications to store and share color swatches. A color swatch is a set of predefined colors that can be used consistently across multiple projects or designs. The ACO file format was first introduced in Photoshop version 6 and has been used in subsequent versions of the software.

ACO files contain list of color values in various formats such as hexadecimal or RGB values. They can be created or edited using Adobe Photoshop's Color Palette Editor which allows users to define new colors and organize them into groups.

ACO files can be shared between users and designers allowing for consistent color usage across different projects and applications. They are also commonly used in web design to ensure consistent color representation across different devices and browsers.

In addition to the ACO format, Adobe Photoshop also supports other color swatch file formats such as ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) and ACT (Adobe Color Table) files. These formats are similar to ACO files, but may have different capabilities and limitations.
