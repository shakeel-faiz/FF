## What is an SO file?

The `.so` file, short for _Shared Object_, is a format used on Unix-based systems, like Linux, for shared libraries. Shared libraries are collections of routines and functions compiled into a single file, allowing different programs to access and execute the code within them without having to recompile or duplicate the code for each program. Think of it as a modular code component that any compatible program can tap into when it needs specific functionalities.

**Purpose of .so Files**

The `.so` files serve a similar purpose to `.dll` (Dynamic Link Library) files on Windows. They help reduce redundancy by storing shared code separately from executables, leading to several benefits:

-   **Memory Efficiency**: Since multiple programs can share a single instance of an `.so` file in memory, this conserves resources, particularly RAM.
-   **Modularity**: They allow for modular program structures where components can be updated or modified independently of the main program.
-   **Easier Maintenance**: Updating a shared library automatically benefits all programs that depend on it, reducing the need for individual updates.

## How to create SO file?

To create a `.so` file, you typically compile source code in C or C++ with special compiler flags. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Write the Source Code**: Start by writing the functions or routines that you intend to share across multiple applications. This could be a collection of math functions, data processing utilities, or other reusable modules.
    
2.  **Compile with Shared Library Flags**: When compiling, you’ll need to include the `-fPIC` (Position Independent Code) flag, which allows the code to be dynamically loaded at runtime, and the `-shared` flag to produce a shared object.
    
    Here’s an example using `gcc`:

```
gcc -fPIC -shared -o libexample.so example.c
```
    
-   `-fPIC` creates position-independent code, essential for shared libraries.
-   `-shared` tells the compiler to output a shared library rather than an executable.

3.  **Naming Convention**: It’s standard to prefix shared libraries with `lib` (e.g., `libexample.so`). This helps the system locate the library when linking it to applications.

## How to use SO files in Programs?

Once you have a `.so` file, it’s ready to be linked with other programs. Here’s how to use it:

1.  **Compile with Linker Option**: To link your program with the shared library, use the `-l` option followed by the library’s name without the `lib` prefix and `.so` suffix.

```
gcc main.c -L/path/to/library -lexample -o main
```
-   `-L` specifies the directory where the compiler can find `libexample.so`.
-   `-lexample` links the program with `libexample.so`.

2.  **Run the Program**: For the program to find the `.so` file at runtime, the library path should be added to the system’s library path (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`):

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/library:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./main
```
