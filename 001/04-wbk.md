## What is a WBK file?

The `.wbk` file format is a **Microsoft Word Document Backup File**. When enabled, Microsoft Word automatically creates `.wbk` backup files to prevent data loss. 

The key features of WBK file include:

-   **Backup Purpose**: `.wbk` files act as a secondary copy of your original Word document. If the main file is corrupted or lost, you can use the `.wbk` file to recover your work.
-   **Automatic Creation**: Word automatically generates a `.wbk` file if the "Always create backup copy" option is enabled in Word's settings.
-   **Location**: Typically, `.wbk` files are stored in the same folder as the original Word document or in a specific backup directory set by Word.

## How to open WBK file?

You can open `.wbk` files directly in **Microsoft Word**:

1.  Open Microsoft Word.
2.  Use the "Open" feature to navigate to the `.wbk` file.
3.  Select and open the `.wbk` file, which should display the document's contents, often representing an earlier version of the original file.

## How to convert WBK file?

If you need to convert a `.wbk` file to a different format, simply open it in Word, then use **Save As** to save it as `.docx`, `.pdf`, or any other format supported by Word.

## How to manage WBK files?

-   **Enable Backups**: You can enable the backup feature in Word by going to `Options > Advanced > Save` and checking the "Always create backup copy" box.
-   **File Cleanup**: Over time, .wbk files can accumulate, especially if you frequently edit documents. You may want to periodically clean up old backups to save space.
