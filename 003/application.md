In this blog, we will discuss what application software is. We will list down different types and categories of application software and explain the difference between application software and apps. Let's get started.

## What is Application Software? 

**Application software** refers to programs designed to perform specific tasks for users. Unlike [system software][1], which manages and operates computer hardware, application software focuses on helping users complete tasks like writing documents, browsing the internet or editing videos. It acts as a bridge between the computer system and the user, enabling them to interact effectively with technology.

Application software is created to carry out specific user tasks, unlike software that manages or operates the computer system. It is also known as an **application program**, **software application**, or simply an **app** (a term commonly used for mobile applications).

Application software is task-specific, meaning each program is developed to perform a particular function, such as word processing, gaming or financial analysis. Designed with end-users in mind, application software typically features user-friendly interfaces. Many applications also allow users to customize settings to suit their specific needs.

## What are Examples of Application Software?

Here, we list some types and examples of application software you might encounter.

- **Productivity Software**:  Helps users complete tasks like writing, calculating and planning. Examples: [Microsoft Word][2], [Google Sheets][4].

- **Multimedia Software**: Used for creating, editing and viewing audio, video and image files. Examples: [Adobe Photoshop][5], [VLC Media Player][6].

- **Web Browsers**: Enable users to access and navigate the internet. Examples: [Google Chrome][7], [Mozilla Firefox][8].

- **Educational Software**: Supports learning through tutorials, exercises and assessments. Examples: [Duolingo][3], Khan Academy.

- **Entertainment Software**: Provides fun and leisure activities like streaming movies, listening to music or playing games. Examples: Netflix, Spotify, Minecraft.

- **Business Software**: Helps in managing business operations like accounting, customer relationship management and inventory. Examples: QuickBooks, Salesforce.

## Application Software vs App

An **app** refers to software designed for mobile devices focusing on specific tasks, while **application software** is a broader term for any software that performs tasks on any device, including desktops, laptops and mobile. All apps are application software, but not all application software are apps.

## What is an App?

An  **app**  (short for "application") is a type of software designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Apps can be installed on devices like smartphones, tablets and computers and they typically provide user-friendly interfaces for accessing various services or functions. Apps can vary widely in their purposes, such as:

1.  **Mobile Apps**: These are apps designed for smartphones and tablets, available through app stores like [Google Play (for Android)][9] or the [Apple App Store (for iOS)][10]. Examples include social media apps, games and productivity tools.
    
2.  **Web Apps**: These apps run on a web browser, so they don't need to be installed on a device. Examples include email services like Gmail, project management tools like Trello, or document editing tools like [Google Docs][11].
    
3.  **Desktop Apps**: These are installed on a computer and typically offer more powerful or specialized features than mobile apps. Examples include word processors like Microsoft Word, design tools like Photoshop, and video editing software.
    
Apps can be  **native**  (built for a specific platform, like iOS or Android) or  **cross-platform**  (built to run on multiple platforms).

## List of General Software Applications

**General application software** refers to software designed to perform a wide range of tasks that can be used by most users in various fields. These applications are not specific to any particular industry but serve general purposes.

1.  **Word Processors**  – Software for creating, editing and formatting text documents (e.g. [Microsoft Word][2], [Google Docs][11]).
2.  **Spreadsheets**  – Software for organizing, analyzing and storing data in tabular form (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets).

5.  **Media Players**  – Software for playing audio and video files (e.g. [VLC Media Player][6], Windows Media Player).
6.  **Presentation Software**  – Software for creating and displaying presentations (e.g. Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides).
7.  **Graphics Software**  – Software for creating and editing images and graphics (e.g. [Adobe Photoshop][5], GIMP).

## Types of Software Applications Based on Software Licensing

The types of software applications based on licensing refer to the distribution methods and the rights given to users. Here are the main types:

2.  **Open-Source Software**: Software whose [source code is made publicly available][28], allowing users to view, modify, and distribute it. Often free to use. Examples:  **Linux**,  **Mozilla Firefox**,  **GIMP**.
    
3.  **Shareware**: Software that is [distributed for free with limited functionality][29] or for a trial period. After the trial ends, the user must pay to continue using the full version. Examples:  **WinRAR**,  **Adobe Photoshop**  (trial versions).
    
4.  **Freemium**: Software that is [free to use with basic features][30], but users must pay for premium features or advanced functionality. Examples:  **Spotify**,  **Dropbox**.
    
5.  **Commercial Software**: Software that is sold to users for a price and is usually fully proprietary. Users typically cannot access or modify the source code. Examples:  **Microsoft Office**,  **AutoCAD**.
    
6.  **Public Domain Software**: Software that has no copyright restrictions and is [freely available to the public for use][31], modification, and distribution. Examples:  **Public domain games**  or older software released for free by developers.
    
7.  **Subscription Software**: Software that is offered on a [subscription basis][32], where users pay recurring fees for access. The subscription can include updates and support. Examples:  **Microsoft 365**,  **Adobe Creative Cloud**.
