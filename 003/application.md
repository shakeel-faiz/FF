**Application software** are computer program designed to perform specific tasks for the user, distinct from those involved in managing or operating the computer itself. It is also known as an application program, software application, or simply an app (a term commonly used for mobile applications).

Application software is task-specific, meaning each program is developed to perform a particular function, such as word processing, gaming or financial analysis. Designed with end-users in mind, application software typically features user-friendly interfaces. Many applications also allow users to customize settings to suit their specific needs.
