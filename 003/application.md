## What is Application Software?

**Application software** refers to programs designed to perform specific tasks for users. Unlike system software, which manages and operates computer hardware, application software focuses on helping users complete tasks like writing documents, browsing the internet or editing videos. It acts as a bridge between the computer system and the user, enabling them to interact effectively with technology.

Application software is created to carry out specific user tasks, unlike software that manages or operates the computer system. It is also known as an **application program**, **software application**, or simply an **app** (a term commonly used for mobile applications).

Application software is task-specific, meaning each program is developed to perform a particular function, such as word processing, gaming or financial analysis. Designed with end-users in mind, application software typically features user-friendly interfaces. Many applications also allow users to customize settings to suit their specific needs.

## Application Software vs App

An **app** refers to software designed for mobile devices focusing on specific tasks, while **application software** is a broader term for any software that performs tasks on any device, including desktops, laptops and mobile. All apps are application software, but not all application software are apps.

## What is an App?

An  **app**  (short for "application") is a type of software designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Apps can be installed on devices like smartphones, tablets and computers and they typically provide user-friendly interfaces for accessing various services or functions. Apps can vary widely in their purposes, such as:

1.  **Mobile Apps**: These are apps designed for smartphones and tablets, available through app stores like Google Play (for Android) or the Apple App Store (for iOS). Examples include social media apps, games and productivity tools.
    
2.  **Web Apps**: These apps run on a web browser, so they don't need to be installed on a device. Examples include email services like Gmail, project management tools like Trello, or document editing tools like Google Docs.
    
3.  **Desktop Apps**: These are installed on a computer and typically offer more powerful or specialized features than mobile apps. Examples include word processors like Microsoft Word, design tools like Photoshop, and video editing software.
    
Apps can be  **native**  (built for a specific platform, like iOS or Android) or  **cross-platform**  (built to run on multiple platforms).
