## What is Database?

A database is an organized collection of data commonly stored and processed by a computer system. It is designed to store, retrieve and manipulate large amounts of structured or unstructured data. Databases are commonly used in various applications such as businesses, banks, schools, websites and more where data needs to be organized and accessed quickly.

Data in a database is organized in tables, files or other structures which makes it easier to manage and access.

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software that helps manage and interact with databases. It ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and updated effectively. Examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

Databases ensure that data is consistent, accurate and accessible by enforcing rules, such as relationships between data elements (e.g. using primary keys and foreign keys).

Databases allow for efficient data retrieval using **SQL (Structured Query Language)** which is a language designed to query and manipulate relational databases.

## What is Data?

Data refers to raw facts, figures or information that can be processed, analyzed or stored. It can exist in many forms such as numbers, text, images or even sounds and is often used to describe attributes, properties or measurements of things. Data is typically the starting point for information when processed or analyzed to reveal meaning or insights. 

For example, a list of temperatures recorded throughout the day is data and once analyzed, it can provide useful information like daily weather patterns. Data can be structured (organized in tables or databases) or unstructured (such as text or multimedia files).

## What are Different Types of Databases?

- **Relational Databases**: A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables with rows and columns. It uses structured query language (SQL) to manage and retrieve data based on relationships between tables. Example: **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**.
    
- **NoSQL Databases**: A NoSQL database is a non-relational database that stores data in a flexible, scalable way, often using key-value pairs, documents or graphs. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data like text, images and videos. Examples include **MongoDB** and **Cassandra**.
    
- **Cloud Databases**: These databases are hosted on cloud platforms and offer scalability, flexibility, and remote access. Examples include **Amazon RDS** and **Google Cloud SQL**.
    
- **Distributed Databases**: In a distributed database, data is stored across multiple physical locations, allowing for improved fault tolerance and performance. Example: **Google Spanner**.

## What are Applications of Databases?

Databases are used across various fields to store, manage and retrieve data such as:

-   **Banking**: For managing customer accounts and financial transactions.
-   **Retail**: For tracking products, sales, and customer data.
-   **Healthcare**: For storing patient information and medical records.
-   **Education**: For managing student data, course details, and grades.
