## What is Database?

A database is an organized collection of data commonly stored and processed by a computer system. It is designed to store, retrieve and manipulate large amounts of structured or unstructured data. Databases are commonly used in various applications such as businesses, banks, schools, websites and more where data needs to be organized and accessed quickly.

Data in a database is organized in tables, files or other structures which makes it easier to manage and access.

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software that helps manage and interact with databases. It ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and updated effectively. Examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

Databases ensure that data is consistent, accurate and accessible by enforcing rules, such as relationships between data elements (e.g. using primary keys and foreign keys).

Databases allow for efficient data retrieval using **SQL (Structured Query Language)** which is a language designed to query and manipulate relational databases.
