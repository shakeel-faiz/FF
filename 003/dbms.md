## What is a database management system (DBMS)?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to create, manage and interact with databases. It provides a structured way to store, retrieve and manipulate data efficiently, ensuring that data remains organized, accessible and secure. With a DBMS, users can perform various operations like adding, updating, deleting and querying data often without needing to know the underlying complexities of data storage.

The key functions of DBMS include the following aspects.

- DBMS is used for data storage and organization. It stores data in an organized form. For example, in the case of a relational database, it organizes data in tables.
- DBMS is used for data retrieval. It allows for quick and efficient data querying using languages like SQL (Structured Query Language).
- DBMS is used for data manipulation. It supports operations to modify data, such as adding, updating or deleting records.
- DBMS is used for data security and to control access to data. It manages user permissions and restricts unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- DBMS is used for data integrity. It ensures accuracy and consistency of data by enforcing rules and relationships.
- DBMS is used for data backup and recovery.

There are different types of DBMS, some of them are following.

- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**: These DBMS deals with relational databases. They organize the data in the form of tables and their relationships. Prominent RDBMS are MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.
- **NoSQL DBMS**: NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL". NoSQL DBMS deals non-tabular data. These DBMS are more flexible in handling large volumes of unstructured data, like MongoDB and Cassandra.
- **Hierarchical and Network DBMS**: Such DBMS store data in tree-like or graph structures.
