## What is a Software?

Software is a set of instructions, programs or data that a computer uses to perform specific tasks. Unlike hardware, which refers to the physical components of a computer, software is intangible and exists as code or digital information. Software tells the hardware what to do and how to do it.

## What are Different Types of Software?

- **System Software**: This includes operating systems (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux) and utility programs that manage and maintain the computer hardware and provide a platform for other software.

- **Application Software**: These are programs designed for end-users to perform specific tasks, such as word processors (e.g. Microsoft Word), web browsers (e.g. Chrome), or games.

- **Programming Software**: Tools that developers use to write, test and debug programs such as compilers, text editors, and IDEs (e.g., Eclipse).

- **Middleware**: Software that acts as a bridge between different applications or systems, enabling them to communicate.

## How Software Works?

Software consists of code written in programming languages like Python, Java or C++. This code is converted into machine language, which the computer can understand. The processor then executes the code to perform tasks. Users interact with the software through interfaces such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or command-line inputs.

Some examples of software include

-   **Operating System**: Windows 10, Linux.
-   **Applications**: Microsoft Excel, Adobe Photoshop.
-   **Games**: Fortnite, Minecraft.
