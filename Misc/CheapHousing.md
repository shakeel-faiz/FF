## üîç What to Check / Questions Before Buying

To avoid problems, make sure:

1. **Legal approval** ‚Äì The society should be approved by the relevant body (LDA etc.).
2. **Possession status** ‚Äì Is the plot ‚Äúon ground‚Äù (i.e. the land is physically ready / leveled / roads accessible) or just a ‚Äúfile‚Äù? Files are cheaper but riskier.
3. **Utilities** ‚Äì Wapda (electricity), gas, water pipelines, sewerage availability.
4. **Road access & connectivity** ‚Äì How far from major roads, public transport, shopping, hospitals etc.
5. **Installment plans** ‚Äì If paying over time, what is the down payment, how many months/years, total cost, extra charges, escalations.
6. **Development status** ‚Äì Has the society done basic infrastructure (roads, street lights, boundary walls etc.)?
