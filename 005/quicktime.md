## What is QuickTime?

QuickTime is a multimedia architecture developed by Apple. It supports various functions such as playing, streaming, encoding and transcoding digital media, including video, audio and images. It also includes QuickTime Player, a built-in media player application for macOS, which was previously available for Windows as well.

QuickTime was introduced in **1991**, at a time when playing digital videos directly on a computer was groundbreaking.

QuickTime had some impressive capabilities. It supported advanced media types, like panoramic images through QuickTime VR, and even Adobe Flash content. Plus, you could expand its functionality by adding new codecs through plug-ins, like Perian.

QuickTime played a significant role in the history of multimedia. During the 1990s, it became a standard in the industry, extensively used in websites, applications, video games, and professional filmmaking. It contributed to innovations, being instrumental in creating iconic video games like _Myst_ and _Xplora1_, and served as the exclusive platform for distributing movie trailers, including _Star Wars_. Moreover, the QuickTime File Format (MOV) laid the groundwork for the MPEG-4 standard, which remains a key format in use today.
