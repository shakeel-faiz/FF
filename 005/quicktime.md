## What is QuickTime?

QuickTime is a multimedia architecture developed by Apple. It supports various functions such as playing, streaming, encoding and transcoding digital media, including video, audio and images. It also includes QuickTime Player, a built-in media player application for macOS, which was previously available for Windows as well.

QuickTime was introduced in **1991**, at a time when playing digital videos directly on a computer was groundbreaking.

QuickTime had some impressive capabilities. It supported advanced media types, like panoramic images through QuickTime VR, and even Adobe Flash content. Plus, you could expand its functionality by adding new codecs through plug-ins, like Perian.

QuickTime played a significant role in the history of multimedia. During the 1990s, it became a standard in the industry, extensively used in websites, applications, video games, and professional filmmaking. It contributed to innovations, being instrumental in creating iconic video games like _Myst_ and _Xplora1_, and served as the exclusive platform for distributing movie trailers, including _Star Wars_. Moreover, the QuickTime File Format (MOV) laid the groundwork for the MPEG-4 standard, which remains a key format in use today.

## What Happened to QuickTime?

Over time, **QuickTime’s relevance decreased**:

-   Operating systems and browsers started natively supporting standards like **MPEG-4** and **H.264**, reducing the need for QuickTime’s cross-platform capabilities.
-   Apple **discontinued QuickTime for Windows in 2016**, citing reduced demand and security issues.

## QuickTime Evolution on macOS

-   With **Mac OS X Snow Leopard** (2009), Apple:
    -   Replaced **QuickTime 7** with **QuickTime Player X**, which:
        -   Used the newer **AVFoundation framework** instead of the older QuickTime framework.
        -   Dropped support for plug-ins and advanced editing (only basic trimming remained).
-   By **macOS Catalina** (2019), support for all 32-bit apps (including QuickTime 7 and QTKit) was removed.
