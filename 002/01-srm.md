## What is an SRM file?

The SRM file is associated with **Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)** save files. When user plays SNES games on emulator, the .srm file serves as saved game file. It records current state of game, allowing players to save and load their progress as needed.

An SRM file is a save data file specifically used with SNES emulators. It stores game progress, player achievements, levels and unlocked items.

## How does an SRM file work?

An SRM file is created whenever SNES games are played on SNES emulators, such as ZSNES or Snes9x, provided the game includes save function. This SRM file captures game's state at the time of saving. When loaded, it restores the game to saved state, allowing player to continue from where they left off.

## How to manage SRM file?

Users can load or manage SRM file by using SNES emulators e.g. ZSNES, Snes9x or RetroArch.

SRM files can also be used for backup and transfer. Players can share their SRM files with each other so that they could share their game progress with other users.
