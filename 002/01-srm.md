## What is an SRM file?

The SRM file is associated with **Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)** save files. When user plays SNES games on emulator, the .srm file serves as saved game file. It records current state of game, allowing players to save and load their progress as needed.

An SRM file is a save data file specifically used with SNES emulators. It stores game progress, player achievements, levels and unlocked items.

## How does an SRM file work?

An SRM file is created whenever SNES games are played on SNES emulators, such as ZSNES or Snes9x, provided the game includes save function. This SRM file captures game's state at the time of saving. When loaded, it restores the game to saved state, allowing player to continue from where they left off.

## How to manage SRM file?

Users can load or manage SRM files using SNES emulators, such as ZSNES, Snes9x, or RetroArch.

SRM files can also be used for backup and transfer. Players can share their SRM files with each other to share their game progress.

## Why Edit or Modify SRM Files?

Some advanced users modify or edit SRM files to change certain values within the game, such as lives or items. For this purpose, hex editors are commonly used. However, caution is necessary, as incorrect editing can corrupt the SRM file.

## How to open SRM file?

To open an SRM file, you typically use an SNES emulator because it contains saved game data. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1.  Choose an SNES emulator that supports SRM files, such as:
    
    -   ZSNES
    -   Snes9x
    -   RetroArch
2.  Install the emulator.
    
3.  Load the game ROM.
    
4.  Load the SRM file.
    
5.  Play the game.
   

Make sure the .srm file has the same name as the ROM file (except for the extension) to ensure it loads correctly. Itâ€™s a good practice to back up your .srm files regularly to prevent data loss.
