## How does SRM file work?

SRM file is always generated when SNES games are played on SNES emulators e.g. ZSNES or Snes9x only if the game has a save functionality. This SRM file reflects the game state. So whenever the SRM file is loaded, it takes the player back to the state where the game was previously saved.
