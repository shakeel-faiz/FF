## What is a PDN file?

The PDN file format is the native format used by Paint.NET, which is a popular free image and photo editing software. The format is specifically designed to store images created or edited in Paint.NET application. The format preserves all layers, settings and effects that occur during editing the image so that user can continue to edit the images without worrying to lose original information relating to source image.

Because of this feature, user can edit individual elements of an image without disturbing the whole composition of image. It also has support for transparency which enable users to create complex designs and graphics that require transparency. Since, PDN retains all editing information of image, user can revise their projects at any time and make changes without compromising quality because of this reason PDN files are larger than other image formats due to extra data inside them that keep the information of layers and effects.
