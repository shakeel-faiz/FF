## What is an OSS file?

The ".oss" file extension is associated with Microsoft Outlook Saved Search File. When you create a search folder in Microsoft Outlook to organize emails, contacts, or other items, it saves the search criteria in an ".oss" file. This file contains the criteria used to define the search folder and is used by Outlook to display the folder's contents dynamically. The ".oss" file does not contain the actual items that are displayed in the search folder, but only the rules used to generate the folder's contents.

You can import or export ".oss" files to other Outlook profiles or computers to use the same search criteria in different installations. To import an ".oss" file, you can use the "Import and Export" feature in Outlook, and to export an ".oss" file, you can right-click the search folder and select "Export Search Folder."

## OSS File Format â€“ More Information

When you create a search folder in Microsoft Outlook and save it as an ".oss" file, it contains the search criteria used to define the folder's contents. The search criteria can include a wide range of parameters that you can use to filter the items that appear in the search folder.

Some examples of search criteria that you can use in Outlook include:

- Keywords or text contained in the subject, body, or attachment of an email
- Sender or recipient email addresses
- Specific dates or date ranges
- Categories or flags assigned to emails
- Importance or sensitivity levels
- Attachment types or file names
- Meeting or appointment organizer or attendees

You can use one or more of these search criteria to create complex search folders that automatically display the items that match the defined criteria. This can help you stay organized and quickly find the emails and other items that are most relevant to you.

In Microsoft Outlook, a search folder is a virtual folder that displays items that meet certain search criteria defined by the user. It does not actually contain any items, but instead, dynamically displays the items that match the search criteria.

To create a search folder in Outlook, you can follow these steps:

1. In the Navigation Pane, right-click on "Search Folders" and select "New Search Folder."
2. Choose the type of items you want to search for, such as emails, contacts, or tasks, and select "Create a custom Search Folder."
3. Click on the "Criteria" button and define the search criteria you want to use. You can select multiple criteria and create complex search conditions.
4. Give the search folder a name and choose where you want to place it in the Navigation Pane.
5. Click "OK" to create the search folder.

Once you have created the search folder, Outlook will automatically display the items that match the search criteria in the folder. You can also customize the view of the search folder, add or remove columns, and sort the items based on different criteria. This allows you to quickly find the items that are most relevant to you without having to manually search for them.
