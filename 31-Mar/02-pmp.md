## What is a PMP file?

The ".pmp" file extension is used by AutoCAD for its Plot Model Parameter File. When you plot a drawing in AutoCAD, the Plot Model Parameter (PMP) file contains the printer-specific settings and configuration used for the plotting process. This file is created automatically when you customize the plot settings in AutoCAD and save them as a named plot style.

The PMP file is used to store the plotter configuration, such as paper size, plot scale, plot area, and plot offset, as well as other settings such as lineweights, linetypes, and pen assignments. By saving these settings in a PMP file, you can easily apply them to future plotting jobs without having to manually configure the printer settings each time.

You can edit the PMP file to modify the plotter settings or create new plot styles with different configurations. The PMP file can be shared with other AutoCAD users or computers to ensure consistent plotting results.

## PMP File Format â€“ More Information

The PMP file is a plain text file that can be opened and edited using any text editor, such as Notepad or Wordpad. In addition to printer-specific settings, the PMP file may also contain plot style settings, such as color mappings, screening, and line weights. AutoCAD supports both system plot styles and named plot styles. System plot styles are predefined plot configurations that come with AutoCAD, while named plot styles are user-defined plot configurations that are saved in a PMP file.

You can customize plot settings in AutoCAD by accessing the Page Setup Manager, which allows you to set up plot configurations for different types of output, such as printing, plotting to a PDF file, or publishing to a DWF file. When you plot a drawing in AutoCAD, you can select the plot style to use from a list of available plot styles. The plot style determines how the objects in the drawing will be plotted based on their properties, such as color, linetype, or lineweight.

## How to create PMP file?

To create a PMP file in AutoCAD, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the drawing file that you want to plot and go to the "Layout" tab.
2. Select "Page Setup Manager" from the "Page Setup" group in the "Layout" tab.
3. In the "Page Setup Manager" dialog box, select "New" to create a new page setup.
4. In the "New Page Setup" dialog box, specify the settings for the new page setup, such as the printer, paper size, plot scale, and plot area. You can also select the plot style to use for the new page setup.
5. Click "OK" to save the new page setup and exit the "New Page Setup" dialog box.
6. Back in the "Page Setup Manager" dialog box, select the new page setup and click "Modify" to make any further adjustments to the plot settings or plot style.
7. Once you have made all the necessary changes, click "Close" to exit the "Page Setup Manager" dialog box.
8. To save the plot settings and plot style as a PMP file, select "Plot Style Manager" from the "Plot" group in the "Output" tab.
9. In the "Plot Style Manager" dialog box, select the plot style that you want to save as a PMP file and click "Export".
10. In the "Export Plot Style Table" dialog box, specify the filename and location for the PMP file and click "Save".
11. The PMP file is now saved and can be used for future plotting jobs.
