## What is an ISS file?

The ".iss" file extension is associated with Inno Setup, which is a free installer for Windows programs. An ISS file is an Inno Setup Script, which is a text file that contains instructions for the Inno Setup compiler on how to create an installer for a specific application. The ISS file contains various settings and configuration options, such as the name and version number of the application, the files to be installed, the installation directories, and other options such as registry settings and desktop shortcuts.

The Inno Setup compiler uses the information in the ISS file to generate an executable setup file that users can run to install the application on their computer. The ISS file can be edited using any text editor, and it can be customized to meet the specific needs of your application's installation process. Inno Setup also includes a Script Wizard that can help you create an ISS file by guiding you through a series of prompts and options. The Script Wizard can be accessed from the Inno Setup Compiler's menu or from the command line.

## ISS File Format - More Information

The Inno Setup compiler is a powerful tool that can create fully customizable and flexible installers for Windows programs. In addition to the ISS file, it uses other file extensions such as ".exe" for the compiled setup file, ".cfg" for the configuration file, and ".log" for the installation log file. Inno Setup scripts are written in Pascal scripting language, which is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. The scripts can be edited using any text editor, and they contain a set of directives that control the behavior of the installer.

ISS files can be used to specify the installation location of the program, the files to be installed, shortcuts to be created, registry keys to be added, and other installation options. They can also be used to define custom pages and dialogs for the installer, add custom code to handle specific installation tasks, and control the uninstallation process. Inno Setup supports a wide range of installation features, including automatic version checking, support for multiple languages, silent installation mode, and customization of the installer's appearance.
