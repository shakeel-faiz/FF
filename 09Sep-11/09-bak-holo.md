## What is a BAK file?

A BAK file in the context of Holo Launcher for Android 2.2+ is essentially a backup file. It is created by this older version of Holo Launcher and serves as a record of a user's personalized settings and shortcuts for their Android launcher. These settings might include things like the layout of app icons, wallpaper, and other visual and functional preferences.

Users of Holo Launcher for Froyo can generate these BAK files through the app's **Backup & Restore** menu. When they choose the "Backup" option, the app compiles all of their current setup and preferences into this BAK file.

By creating these BAK files, users can safeguard their personalized setup and easily restore it later if they make changes or need to reinstall the launcher. It is a convenient way to preserve their preferred look and feel of their Android device.
