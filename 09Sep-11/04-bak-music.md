## What is a BAK file?

A BAK file in the context of MakeMusic Finale, a music notation application, is essentially a backup copy of a musical score. These files are automatically generated and serve as a safeguard for your work. The BAK file contains the same musical data as its associated .MUS file but is saved with the ".bak.mus" file extension. If you ever need to recover or revert to a previous version of your musical score in Finale, you can use the BAK file to do so. It's a valuable feature to prevent data loss and maintain the integrity of your music compositions.

You can also stop Finale from creating BAK files using the following steps

1. Open Finale.
2. Access the program's Preferences or Settings menu.
3. In the Preferences menu, select the "Save" section from the left-hand sidebar.
4. Look for an option that says "Make Backups When Saving Files" or something similar.
5. Uncheck or clear the checkbox next to this option.
