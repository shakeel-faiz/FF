## What is a BAK file?

A .BAK file also serves as a database backup file generated by Swiftpage Act!, which is a customer relationship management (CRM) software. This file includes a duplicate of an Act! database (usually an .ADF file), effectively preserving essential data such as customer contacts, company details, group information, notes, historical records, and activity data stored within the database.

## Swiftpage Act!

Swiftpage Act! is a software application used for customer relationship management (CRM). It's designed to help businesses and organizations manage their customer interactions, track sales and marketing activities, and store essential contact information. Swiftpage Act! offers features such as contact management, email marketing, calendar and task management, sales automation, and reporting to streamline and enhance customer relationship management processes.

Within Act!, all customer-related data is stored in a dedicated database file, which can be backed up at the discretion of Act! managers and administrators. This backup is especially crucial when, for instance, a business is planning to upgrade to a new version of Act!. In such cases, the IT administrator responsible for Act! might opt to create a backup of the Act! database.

These Act! database backups are saved in the form of BAK files. Typically, during the backup process, these BAK files are bundled into a .ZIP file. This ZIP archive not only contains the core Act! database backup but also includes associated Act! data elements, such as attached documents, document templates, report templates, and saved database queries. This comprehensive backup approach ensures that critical customer information and related resources are protected and readily recoverable when needed.
