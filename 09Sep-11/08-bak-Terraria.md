## What is a BAK file?

In the context of the video game Terraria, ".bak" files are typically associated with world or player backup files. Terraria is a popular sandbox adventure game where players explore, build, and battle in a 2D pixel-art world. Backing up your world and player data is essential to prevent loss of progress or characters.

When you back up a Terraria world, the game creates a copy of the world file with a `.wld.bak` extension. The ".wld" file represents your Terraria world, containing all the terrain, structures, and items you've created or collected in that world. The ".wld.bak" file serves as a backup in case your main world file gets corrupted or if you want to revert to a previous version of your world.

Similarly, when you back up a Terraria character or player, the game creates a copy of the player file with a `.plr.bak` extension. The ".plr" file contains information about your character's inventory, equipment, stats, and progress in the game. The ".plr.bak" file is a safeguard against character data loss.
